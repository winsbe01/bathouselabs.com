With the whole world crumbling, our fingertips outstretched towards hazy skies, small clouds hovering like a child’s misty exhale on a cold November morning, mothers’ tears freezing on cheeks, brothers and sisters playing War in gardens amidst the proud sunflowers and lowly chrysanthemums, you and I, we pick this time to fall in love.

Of every hour, every minute this lonely Earth knows, every possibility each fraction of a moment offers, we pick this time, a peak of despair, a crescendo of corruption, to fall haplessly, hopelessly in love.

We were seventeen that May morning we met first, I an old boy, you a young woman, a nymph among your mortal peers.  We talked sparingly that day; you mentioned your name, I mine.  Little else was exchanged through spoken words, though our hearts did flutter in tune.  Your smile was gentle, your eyes so warm I could crawl in and stay forever, your hair long and thick.  To touch your hand was to hold close Mother Earth, and feel the heartbeat of all things pulse through my body.

In three months time, I found the courage to kiss you, a kiss that rendered breaths of air and the heat of the sun irrelevant.  You spoke softly, placing the words delicately on my lips, that I could hear you even if I were deaf.  Our fingers locked together like a hinge, and our arms would swing on our nightly walks down dimly lit drives, past strong trees, gentle grass, and deeply breathing homes.

We pick this time to fall, and the Earth does follow.

People died. Towers fell. Mothers wept. Children stared. Politicians spoke. People sneered. Decisions were made. Politicians lied.  Bombs fell.  People scowled.  Fear came cast in colors.  Policies changed.  Markets rose.  Politicians yelled.  People cheered.  Families broke.  Newscasters spoke.  Maps came covered in dots.  People screamed. Children cried.  Countries fell.

In the mailbox, in a stamped envelope, a letter came.  *A Call to Arms,* it said, *Your Country Needs You.*  *Please Contact Us,* it said.  *This is Not a Request,* it said.

I called you, and you came.  We read the letter aloud, sentence by sentence, word by word, syllable by syllable, searching for a weak link in the shackles.  None was found.  You cried, I cried, We cried together, and the ink ran in rivers, dripped silently to the floor.

It was all too much, and all too quick, because of every lingering second since the sun first rose, to every waning minute till it finally sets, we pick this time to fall in love, as the whole world crumbles.

So I stand here in the sand, a million miles away, always in lines, my generation of brothers always looking down, lost in memory, and I think of us.  Of how you, and I, and the whole world, and everyone, has picked this time to fall.
