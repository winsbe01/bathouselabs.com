Here it is, *Pink Friday*, the debut album from Young Money's latest superstar Nicki Minaj. After being featured by artists across the map in radio hits and album tracks, she finally gets her own 17 tracks to play around with. She's proven her talent as a contributing artist, but how does she do in the hotseat?

In a word: greatish (what?). Let me explain. Nicki had a tall order to fill with *Pink Friday.* She wasn't exactly a nobody when it was released, so critics and fans alike were expecting a lot from her first album. And she did deliver a lot. But, what threw some people off guard (myself included) was how poppy the album is.

Why is poppy bad? Well, let's look at it from my perspective. Nicki's appearances on other tracks were often, how do you say, *terrifying.* Maybe it was her vocals ranging from sweet innocent schoolgirl to seasoned ax-murderer, or maybe it was how she could work up a disgusting rhyme while looking like a pink plastic doll. Regardless, it was scary.

Her solo work? Not as scary as much of the time. I grabbed an extra set of underpants when I put the album on, fully expecting to need them. But alas, just a few dribbles escaped, so they went back in the drawer unsoiled.

So, it's *great* that she's made an album's worth of solid, interesting music, presumably that she's proud of (she sure talks a lot about being *totally awesome*, after all). However, it's *ish* that it wasn't quite what we were expecting or hoping for. But maybe that's not such a bad thing after all.

**Listen to it if:** you're on a Young Money kick, or want to know how Nicki writes, not just what she contributes to.

**Memorable Tunes:** Roman's Revenge. This track features Nicki and Eminem tearing it up over a simple, uptempo beat. I personally think Em is a force to be reckoned with, and Nicki absolutely holds her own on this track, further solidifying her well deserved reputation.
