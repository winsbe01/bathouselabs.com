Ah, the 90's. The golden age of Alternative Rock.

Here's a story for ya: I was at a concert over spring break. A few of my friends and I were in Daytona Beach, and went to a block party on St. Patrick's Day knowing that they'd have live music (which was infinitely more enjoyable then the pseudo-techno crap we were force-fed in the club the night before). I checked the name of the band, and didn't recognize them. This got me worried -- not because I hadn't heard of the band before (I love new music, can ya tell?), but because drunk college kids love nothing more than to dance and sing to something they recognize. They're also not afraid to make fools out of themselves, but that's a different story. Anyways, the band finally came on to some moderate cheering, and they kicked off an excellent, multi-set show of cover songs from the 90's. It was a knockout; they played the songs of our generation and rocked them. I'm sure every one of the band members got laid that night.

Anywho, 90's rock kicks ass. Nuff said.

**Listen to it if:** you're ages 19-26, or just love some fun music.

**Memorable Tunes:** Inside Out. Yes, the song from the radio. I grew up with it, I love it, I didn't realize I had it, so I'm really excited now!
