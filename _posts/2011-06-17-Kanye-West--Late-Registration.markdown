Kanye West is...something else. Before my foray into hip-hop, I thought he sucked. After he interrupted Taylor Swift at the VMAs, I thought he was a jackass. Then I heard *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,* and I realized that only one of those two things is true. Well, really only half, cause Beyonce's video was pretty great, and there are plenty of times when I wish Taylor Swift would shut her mouth.

Anyways, this album isn't *MBDTF,* this is back from the "Golddigger" days. I was worried it would pale in comparison, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it held its own. Well, mostly. The album is really long at 21 songs, and I was getting kind of tired of them after awhile. But in the first 2/3 of the album, Kanye absolutely kills it, making sure we understand that he really is one of the best hip hop artists living. A force to be reckoned with. Also, very stylish. He loves designer clothes, more than some girls I know.

**Listen to...** hold on, Imma let you finish, but I just wanted to say that my sunglasses are the most ridiculous piece of clothing of all time. *OF ALL TIME.*

**Memorable Tunes:** Drive Slow. I want to crank this in my car. It's got a steady, hypnotizing groove that's absolutely intoxicating. On second thought, maybe I shouldn't crank it in my car...
