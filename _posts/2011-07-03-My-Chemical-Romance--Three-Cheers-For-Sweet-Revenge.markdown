I really don't have anything super interesting to say. This album was very emotional, with slight reservation on the "tional" part. But, as far as these types of bands and albums go, it really wasn't that bad. I know, you were hoping I'd make fun of their sound, or their song names, or the fact that the album cover is a picture of a guy and a girl, presumably on their wedding day, covered in blood spatter, drawn in an anime paper-cutout kind of way, but I'm not going to. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Don't get me wrong; I'll never listen to it again, but I won't have nightmares about it for years either.

**Listen to it if:** you're heartbroken and you wanna hear someone whine about it in music.

**Memorable Tunes:** I'm Not Okay (I Promise). I think this is actually a cry for help. Like, someone should go check on this guy, he sounds like he's in a really bad place.
