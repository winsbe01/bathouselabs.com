Too long, I've come to listen to the sea <br />
At sunup, when the tide is crawling in. <br />
Before the day's inspired to lend its noises, <br />
I've sat along the shore and heard the voices. <br />
A million ancient souls in harmony, <br />
Far greater than a mortal choral din.

Far be it for the innocent to see <br />
That, after living, death is not a sin. <br />
Though life itself has offered many choices, <br />
I choose to listen closely to the voices <br />
In hopes that I may find eternal Me, <br />
Before the other's time should wear too thin.
