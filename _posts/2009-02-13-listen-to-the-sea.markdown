Too long, I've come to listen to the sea
At sunup, when the tide is crawling in.
Before the day's inspired to lend its noises,
I've sat along the shore and heard the voices.
A million ancient souls in harmony,
Far greater than a mortal choral din.

Far be it for the innocent to see
That, after living, death is not a sin.
Though life itself has offered many choices,
I choose to listen closely to the voices
In hopes that I may find eternal Me,
Before the other's time should wear too thin.
