It's been a while since I read <br />
a good story, not one used <br />
to teach some backwards concept, under <br />
the command of some near-dead <br />
stick, inflated with old belief. <br />
I don't think it's right.

Don't we as students have the right <br />
to consume our own world, and read <br />
what we deem important? My belief, <br />
not a personal mantra used <br />
to discredit yours, is some dead <br />
men don't need to be dug up. Under

a heavy blanket of history, my under- <br />
standing gets lost between a write- <br />
er's words and his intentions. Maybe it's dead <br />
language that trips me, or an avid read- <br />
er's constant deja vu, but tasting used <br />
thoughts bubbling from the belief

of a grave man, a belief <br />
buried even before he himself was under <br />
ground, makes me feel used. <br />
Sure, we each have a moral right <br />
to speak, feel, write, and read <br />
what we wish, but when you're dead

it's hard to argue. When I am dead <br />
and gone, I don't expect my belief <br />
to outlive me, nor my words be read <br />
by anyone who doesn't wish to under- <br />
stand them. Words are not an objective rite <br />
of passage, nor should they be used

as such. Their appropriate use <br />
is to bring one out of an intellectual dead <br />
land, to a bright <br />
plain of self-acknowledgment, belief <br />
in one's own under- <br />
standing of the world. Read

these dead words, this twisted belief, <br />
but look underneath them. They read <br />
just like the used words they condemn. Right?
