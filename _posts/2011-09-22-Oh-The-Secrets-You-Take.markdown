Do I soothe you?

After endless days stuffed in <br />
stiff starched shirts, <br />
long meetings and hard handshakes, <br />
infiltrations, penetrations, <br />
wiretaps, covert ops, <br />
seeking out and killing Red <br />
to save the White and Blue, <br />
what do I do for you?

Me, an ivory piece of lace, <br />
two cups to hold you, <br />
two straps to squeeze <br />
and a clasp to keep you in one piece, <br />
buried in your closet like a dead man.

When the shades are drawn, <br />
the lights dim, the streets a soft whisper, <br />
you exhume me, hold me up <br />
and slip me over your bare arms. <br />
How do I feel?

When you reach around to buckle me, <br />
push me up on your hard chest, <br />
adjust the strap on your shoulder, <br />
how do I make you feel?

Your eyes in the mirror are heavy. <br />
Is it shame?  Fatigue? <br />
Or do you dread loosening the straps, <br />
undoing the clasp, slipping me off, and <br />
crawling naked into bed knowing <br />
I will never be able to satisfy?

Oh, the secrets we keep.
