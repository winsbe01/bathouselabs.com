This is the original we're talking about, not the more popular and less inspired Carter III. This album features Weezy before he got big, and much like Jay-Z, his raps were much grittier and more interesting before anyone really knew who he was. I loved this album, minus the length. 21 long tracks really wore on me after awhile. But Weezy's rhymes throughout are killer.

Speaking of Weezy's rhymes, ever notice how he rhymes the same thing over and over again? Like, ending a group of four phrases with "in this bitch" or "mo' fucka". I mean, they all rhyme, sure, and he rhymes the word previous to these repeated phrases, so it's different, but still.

**Listen to it if:** you love Wayne, but also underground hip-hop.

**Memorable Tunes:** Cash Money Millionaires. The beat is nasty, and the verses are dope.
