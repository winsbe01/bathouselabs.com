good old ted<br />
clean cut catch

bright future with<br />
a sharpest mind

who did it in seventy-six<br />
with thirty at twenty-nine

and got them to believe<br />
in the break and the bug<br />
like innocence Herself.

when they gave him twenty-five-to-death<br />
he jumped

and slipped through butterfingers<br />
like water

but washed back up<br />
with a sure-fire smile

to catch a break, and ride<br />
electric wings to join his<br />
palefaced sweethearts in a

violent sensual everafter.
