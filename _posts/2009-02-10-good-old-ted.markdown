good old ted
clean cut catch

bright future with
a sharpest mind

who did it in seventy-six
with thirty at twenty-nine

and got them to believe
in the break and the bug
like innocence Herself.

when they gave him twenty-five-to-death
he jumped

and slipped through butterfingers
like water

but washed back up
with a sure-fire smile

to catch a break, and ride
electric wings to join his
palefaced sweethearts in a

violent sensual everafter.
