you do not do, you do not do <br />
anymore, Sylvia, <br />
your thumb stump a lid stamp, <br />
redcoats feeding flowers <br />
(chrysanthemums, every one)

a Lady of the Earth, <br />
box in a green field, <br />
fair skin and farewell <br />
to that jar, that bell <br />
who ate up all your air

and pushed you head-first <br />
into an oven. Is this <br />
how you depart? singed <br />
hair and hospital wards, <br />
not enough for your thick words.

to die a third time, like a Jew, <br />
are there marks of the boot-heel? <br />
was it a poem, like everything else, <br />
or were we not enough for you? <br />
Oh Sylvia, *Ach du.*
