Love is human's felony <br />
(The purpose of our woes), <br />
A sweet macabre melody <br />
A tainted God imposed <br />
Created as a punishment <br />
For sinners long deceased, <br />
Or maybe 'twas a horrid curse <br />
That Pandora released. <br />
It serves no greater purpose but <br />
To haunt us night and day <br />
It renders us unconscious and <br />
It carries us away. <br />
A wiser man once told me that <br />
The menace knows no time; <br />
But when I leave my earthly lot, <br />
I hope Love stays behind.
