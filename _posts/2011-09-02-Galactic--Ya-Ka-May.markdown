Best known for their bouncy New-Orleans-inspired funk/jazz tunes, Galactic has done a couple albums now that features outside artists extensively. Their first, *From the Corner to the Block*, features a bunch of emcees (different ones for each song) that lend their vocal talents to Galactic's groove. I was in love with that album in college, so when I saw *Ya-Ka-May* featured a bunch of people as well, I couldn't resist giving it a spin.

However, when comparing the two directly, *Ya-Ka-May* doesn't live up to its elder sibling. It's not even close, in my opinion. "But," you might say, comparing them is a bit like apples and oranges!" Yes, *FTCTTB* was all hip-hop tracks with a couple instrumentals and *Ya-Ka-May* had more of a mix of sounds and voices. However, putting aside the fact that I was hoping beyond hope for another funk/hip-hop mashup, as Galactic has proven capable of, this album just didn't have a real spark to it. There were a few standout tracks, but as a whole, it is a pretty forgettable album.

Now, this isn't to say that the music isn't good; Galactic does funk/jazz better than any group I've ever heard, this album included. It just didn't have the same intensity as their other albumsdo, which was a bit disappointing.

**Listen to it if:** you enjoy music that makes you bob your head.

**Memorable Tunes:** Dark Water. This, in my opinion, is the best track on the album. It isn't quite hip-hop, so it wouldn't have fit on *FTCTTB*, but it has the same intensity and feeling.
