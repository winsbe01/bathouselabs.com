I would have liked to meet her.
I wish I had the chance.
She would have been beautiful,
I'm sure of it.  I can picture
her soft hair, her pretty dresses,
and us with the same brown eyes,
deep and rich like chocolate.
I can almost feel her now.

Some dark nights, after the
sun drops down behind the Earth
and the ghosts have all slithered
back into the cracks in the floor,
I can almost hear her crying.
It breaks my heart to hear it,
and yet I want to hear it,
I want to be able to lay
next to her, to calm her, and
feel her heartbeat in my body
like it was my own.

I would like to feel her soft skin,
and listen as her breathing slows,
as she drifts off into a
peaceful night of sleep.
I wish for nothing but her peace.

Was this my fault?
Did I do something wrong?
At five weeks, in the sterile office
with posters of mothers' insides,
the doctor plainly said we were healthy,
both of us, as healthy as could be
expected, as could be hoped for.
Even at eighteen weeks, this time
in a cold room with a colder
exam table, the tired nurse with
her gloves and jelly said all was perfect.
There were two legs.  There were two arms.
There were fingers and toes, and a
thumb in a mouth, eyes closed.
There were pictures to prove it.

Soon after, there was kicking, and
there was celebrating.  Everyone
smiled on the streets, everyone
reached out to touch me, to feel
the kicks, the miracle. There were
already plans for birthdays,
plans for weddings.  

Preemptive, though,
as thirty-two weeks hit
hard with a kick straight into
the delivery room.  There was
grunting, crying, dial tones, and a
red-blue-red-blue screaming that
soon turned to a fluorescent banter
of medical terms, with an overbearing
pain that connected the there to here.

In a new room now, blurred lights
hanging down from ceilings,
distant white walls and large
metal forceps, stirrups and stages
and agonized screaming.

Heads spinning, brows sweating,
words flying from behind green masks
like bullets, cutting, yelling in mouths
and ears for everyone to hear, in heads
for everyone to feel, pain, lights,
Red and White.
Blue.

The body crawled its way into the world
through a newly mangled hole.
An umbilical cord it wore
like a necklace, a noose,
with appendages dangling in the
doctor's arms like dead weights.

Our two-in-one became
one and none before anyone
could breathe a word.

There was a funeral.
She looked painfully pale.
I wanted to kiss her eyelids
and cry for her,
the one I was so close
to having, to touching, to being with
every dawn, every dusk, every day.

I wish I could have met her.
Oh mother, I wish we could have met.
