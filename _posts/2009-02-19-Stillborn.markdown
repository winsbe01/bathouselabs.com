I would have liked to meet her. <br />
I wish I had the chance. <br />
She would have been beautiful, <br />
I'm sure of it.  I can picture <br />
her soft hair, her pretty dresses, <br />
and us with the same brown eyes, <br />
deep and rich like chocolate. <br />
I can almost feel her now.

Some dark nights, after the <br />
sun drops down behind the Earth <br />
and the ghosts have all slithered <br />
back into the cracks in the floor, <br />
I can almost hear her crying. <br />
It breaks my heart to hear it, <br />
and yet I want to hear it, <br />
I want to be able to lay <br />
next to her, to calm her, and <br />
feel her heartbeat in my body <br />
like it was my own.

I would like to feel her soft skin, <br />
and listen as her breathing slows, <br />
as she drifts off into a <br />
peaceful night of sleep. <br />
I wish for nothing but her peace.

Was this my fault? <br />
Did I do something wrong? <br />
At five weeks, in the sterile office <br />
with posters of mothers' insides, <br />
the doctor plainly said we were healthy, <br />
both of us, as healthy as could be <br />
expected, as could be hoped for. <br />
Even at eighteen weeks, this time <br />
in a cold room with a colder <br />
exam table, the tired nurse with <br />
her gloves and jelly said all was perfect. <br />
There were two legs.  There were two arms. <br />
There were fingers and toes, and a <br />
thumb in a mouth, eyes closed. <br />
There were pictures to prove it.

Soon after, there was kicking, and <br />
there was celebrating.  Everyone <br />
smiled on the streets, everyone <br />
reached out to touch me, to feel <br />
the kicks, the miracle. There were <br />
already plans for birthdays, <br />
plans for weddings.  

Preemptive, though, <br />
as thirty-two weeks hit <br />
hard with a kick straight into <br />
the delivery room.  There was <br />
grunting, crying, dial tones, and a <br />
red-blue-red-blue screaming that <br />
soon turned to a fluorescent banter <br />
of medical terms, with an overbearing <br />
pain that connected the there to here.

In a new room now, blurred lights <br />
hanging down from ceilings, <br />
distant white walls and large <br />
metal forceps, stirrups and stages <br />
and agonized screaming.

Heads spinning, brows sweating, <br />
words flying from behind green masks <br />
like bullets, cutting, yelling in mouths <br />
and ears for everyone to hear, in heads <br />
for everyone to feel, pain, lights, <br />
Red and White. <br />
Blue.

The body crawled its way into the world <br />
through a newly mangled hole. <br />
An umbilical cord it wore <br />
like a necklace, a noose, <br />
with appendages dangling in the <br />
doctor's arms like dead weights.

Our two-in-one became <br />
one and none before anyone <br />
could breathe a word.

There was a funeral. <br />
She looked painfully pale. <br />
I wanted to kiss her eyelids <br />
and cry for her, <br />
the one I was so close <br />
to having, to touching, to being with <br />
every dawn, every dusk, every day.

I wish I could have met her. <br />
Oh mother, I wish we could have met.
