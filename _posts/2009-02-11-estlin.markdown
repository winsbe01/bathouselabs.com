born a cambridge mouse, were you
kissing angels with your quill
feather dusting over cheeks,
gardens bowing ever deep to
birds who cry *in Just-
spring?*
could you smell the
virgin words?

smiling at La Ferté-Macé
with B., in an enormous room,
did the angels kiss instead?

you were a child of ezra and gerty,
we thought,
but found your hand with sam and will
(your heart and member elsewhere), still
praying for your favorite dead priest
*(bitter all utterly things sweet)*
as the sunken shadows of afterthought
came prancing up the river Styx.

you rubbed lightly words on a page
that anyone and noone may hold hands
side by side, in graves,
and you may ever charge laughing
*into the strenuous briefness*
with your seasoned women and blooming mind,
it’s no wonder you had us convinced.

*les petites femmes exactes qui dansent toujours*
in our heads, the words
still stand thick and strong
and make us wonder:
what would we do, what *could* we do
that you haven’t?
