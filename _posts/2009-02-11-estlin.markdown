born a cambridge mouse, were you <br />
kissing angels with your quill <br />
feather dusting over cheeks, <br />
gardens bowing ever deep to <br />
birds who cry *in Just- <br />
spring?* <br />
could you smell the <br />
virgin words?

smiling at La Ferté-Macé <br />
with B., in an enormous room, <br />
did the angels kiss instead?

you were a child of ezra and gerty, <br />
we thought, <br />
but found your hand with sam and will <br />
(your heart and member elsewhere), still <br />
praying for your favorite dead priest <br />
*(bitter all utterly things sweet)* <br />
as the sunken shadows of afterthought <br />
came prancing up the river Styx.

you rubbed lightly words on a page <br />
that anyone and noone may hold hands <br />
side by side, in graves, <br />
and you may ever charge laughing <br />
*into the strenuous briefness* <br />
with your seasoned women and blooming mind, <br />
it’s no wonder you had us convinced.

*les petites femmes exactes qui dansent toujours* <br />
in our heads, the words <br />
still stand thick and strong <br />
and make us wonder: <br />
what would we do, what *could* we do <br />
that you haven’t?
