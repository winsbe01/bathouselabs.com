Meet me, my love, at evening's tide, <br />
Behind the rocks where children hide. <br />
Bring us a perfect storybook <br />
Of noble birth or suicide.

But wait! lie back and upwards look, <br />
Until the moon shines bright and wide. <br />
Until the grass with dew is shook, <br />
Your passions to the stars confide.

Then read to me the words of pride <br />
From lover's lips, until I've cried <br />
And squeezed your hand, for mine you took <br />
In yours, our fingers intertwined.

Until the morn' is undertook, <br />
Remain with me, love, just beside. <br />
We're two young souls and one old book, <br />
A bond too strong to e'er divide.
