Meet me, my love, at evening's tide,
Behind the rocks where children hide.
Bring us a perfect storybook
Of noble birth or suicide.

But wait! lie back and upwards look,
Until the moon shines bright and wide.
Until the grass with dew is shook,
Your passions to the stars confide.

Then read to me the words of pride
From lover's lips, until I've cried
And squeezed your hand, for mine you took
In yours, our fingers intertwined.

Until the morn' is undertook,
Remain with me, love, just beside.
We're two young souls and one old book,
A bond too strong to e'er divide.
