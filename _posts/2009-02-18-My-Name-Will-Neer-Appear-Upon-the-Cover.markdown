title: My Name Will Ne'er Appear Upon the Cover
category: writing
---

My name will ne’er appear upon the cover, <br />
These dusty pages ever chewed by age, <br />
This welcome curse has yet to cause me bother.

Because I smear these pungent words like fodder, <br />
It’s no use feeling down or in a rage. <br />
My name will ne’er appear upon the cover. 

I’ve nursed each word I slipped, as from my mother <br />
Though teeth I bare bite nipple, page by page. <br />
This welcome curse has yet to cause me bother.

With corporate English I could surely barter <br />
And crawl into a legal tender cage <br />
If just to see my name upon the cover.

But why should I make models of another <br />
To fake a scene on literary stage? <br />
This welcome curse has yet to cause me bother.

This life is not a molded-plastic wonder <br />
And Art is not a token or a phase. <br />
My name will ne’er appear upon the cover. <br />
This welcome curse has yet to cause me bother.
