title: My Name Will Ne'er Appear Upon the Cover
category: writing
---

My name will ne’er appear upon the cover,
These dusty pages ever chewed by age,
This welcome curse has yet to cause me bother.

Because I smear these pungent words like fodder,
It’s no use feeling down or in a rage.
My name will ne’er appear upon the cover. 

I’ve nursed each word I slipped, as from my mother
Though teeth I bare bite nipple, page by page.
This welcome curse has yet to cause me bother.

With corporate English I could surely barter
And crawl into a legal tender cage
If just to see my name upon the cover.

But why should I make models of another
To fake a scene on literary stage?
This welcome curse has yet to cause me bother.

This life is not a molded-plastic wonder
And Art is not a token or a phase.
My name will ne’er appear upon the cover.
This welcome curse has yet to cause me bother.
