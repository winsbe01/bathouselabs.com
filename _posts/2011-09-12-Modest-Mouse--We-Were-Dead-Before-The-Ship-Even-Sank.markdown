title: Modest Mouse -- We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank
category: music
---

I really wanted to like this album. I really did. Here's why: my girlfriend and I
have very similar tastes in music, with a few notable exceptions.

She really enjoys 
The Decemberists, Death Cab For Cutie, and Modest Mouse. When we first met, I didn't want anything to 
do with any of these groups. Over time, she's convinced me to come around on The Decemberists,
to the point where I now regularly listen to them. She's been trying to do the same for
Modest Mouse for awhile now, and I've been resisting. But, up it came in the alphabet,
so I dutifully grabbed one of their albums and loaded it onto my player.

I think part of what makes me so resistive to Modest Mouse is the lead singer's voice. To my ears, it
may as well be teenage girls squealing while dragging their fingernails across a chalkboard.
It drives me absolutely insane. Their songs make me physically uncomfortable
and angry. Just thinking about Float On solidifies my belief that God is dead, 
because no benevolent creator would subject his children to such horrific torture.
Even a vengeful God would say "Yo, hold up, that might be a *little* too far..."

Okay, so this album wasn't *quite* that bad, but it's supposedly one of their 
better albums. For the sake of my sanity, I'd hate to hear one of their crappy ones.

**Listen to it if:** you are blissfully ignorant to the evils of the world.

**Memorable Tunes:** Fire It Up. When this song started, I actually got into it. It has a
neat sound, something you can enjoy. Then the singing starts, and I think I blacked out,
which must have been my body's involuntary attempt at damage control.
