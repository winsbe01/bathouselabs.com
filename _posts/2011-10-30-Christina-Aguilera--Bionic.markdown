Who is Christina Aguilera?

Unlike a particular Ayn Rand novel (or paper weight, doorstop, chew toy, proof of the devil, etc.), I probably won't have a good answer for you when this micro rant is done. However, I do hope to paint for you a picture of the absolute insanity of the career of this otherwise fantastic artist to the best of my ability and through my own skewed perception.

Well.

The positive things I emphasize here may come as a surprise to some people. Not that these things are positive or negative, per se, but that I will be saying them in earnest. The other day, I was perusing the local Barnes & Noble, an activity I often find myself doing in an attempt to be "social" without the annoyance of actually having to talk to people. I had my headphones on, and since I probably looked like *the man,* the gentleman who rung up my purchase asked me what I happened to be listening to. Since I am not one to lie to strangers (why the hell not? Note to self, start lying to strangers), I told him: Christina Aguilera. Imagine his surprise, and the awkward conversation that followed because he couldn't just *ignore* me now after initiating a vocal interchange, though he looked like he desperately wanted to. I don't blame his surprised reaction; I was giving off quite the air of badassedness. I was buying *Scarface,* for goodness sake. How was he to know that asking my current playlist selection would pop the bubble of cool that hovers around me at all times? Curse my eclectic ear!

But in all seriousness, I'm not super embarrassed about listening to her. She is one of the most talented singers I've ever heard. Not of the year, not of the decade. Of ever. Her voice might not be for everyone, but hate her or love her, it's hard to argue with her skill. (What are those ridiculous frilly soprano runs she does? It sounds like someone kicked her down the stairs mid-song.)

Don't believe me? Still think she's a hack? Check out [this live performance][jamesbrown] of her honoring the late, great Godfather of Soul. Then come back with a handwritten apology. I can wait.

So we've established her talent as a singer. But who is she as an artist? What makes Ms. Aguilera's sound unique?

Her voice...and that's it. This is where the problems start to surface. If anyone else out there has followed her career, you probably understand what I mean.

Christina's first album came out around the time Britney Spears became an international pop sensation. Suspiciously enough, Christina's image was similar to Britney's: a budding late-teen, subtly sexual with an air of innocence (or vice versa). In fact, it was so similar that at 9 years old, I recognized the shenanigans and promptly labeled Christina a ripoff.

After a few years, as many may remember, Britney's image (d)evolved from the innocently seductive girl-next-door type to a "stripper robot fueled by blowjobs," a quote I'm going to subtly mis-attribute to someone else because I don't fully understand the fifth amendment. Naturally, Christina tried her damnedest to keep up with or even surpass the in-cum-bant's premier sextronic programming.

Then, when we were sure we had seen the last of Christina (mostly because we were sure (or at least surely hoping) we had seen the last of Britney), a new album came out: *Back To Basics,* a dual-disc masterpiece where Christina intermingled the themes and sounds of old blues music with a modern, hip-pop sound. And it worked magnificently. The music sounded awesome, but most of all, it sounded truly unique. I thought the world was finally seeing the *real* Christina Aguilera, and I was beyond excited.

Oh, how wrong I was. *Bionic,* the most recent release, is back to targeting to top of the pop charts. But this time around it isn't Britney. It's "Lady" Gaga.

While Christina doesn't come riding onto the sound stage carried by Native American warriors wearing a somehow-sexy dress of venison and a hairnet made of children's teeth (which is, incidentally, Gaga's plan for the Grammys this year), the sound of *Bionic* is highly computerized and processed, in direct contrast with the gritty authenticity of the *Back To Basics* tracks. The entire album isn't like this, thank God, but the overarching theme seems to be fabricated competition for Lady Gaga and her contemporaries, the unfortunate wave of shock-pop fiends that will inevitably be here any day now. (Wait, Katy Perry. Dammit).

Beyond this obvious rip of the current popular music scene, the music itself is pretty good. I mean, it doesn't make up for her insane genre-shifting antics, but remember, she does have a good voice. If I focus enough on that, the peripheral stuff gets blurry, and life is bearable once again.

**Listen to it if:** your musical tastes follow the Top 40, or you can appreciate a good voice and can ignore everything else around it.

**Memorable Tunes:** Woohoo. In this song, "Woohoo" isn't a phrase you say when you find out some great news. Christina is referring to her vagina (which, I suppose, makes the first sentence valid after all). Even if her entire career has been a fabrication of record company executives, one thing has stayed constant: Christina is extremely sexual. Vehemently. Plus, the song features [Nicki Minaj][nicki], a woman whose sexuality I can only describe as "militant."
