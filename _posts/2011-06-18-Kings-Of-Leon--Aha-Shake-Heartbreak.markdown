title: Kings Of Leon -- Aha Shake Heartbreak
category: music
---

This wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. My experience with Kings Of Leon to this point was the seemingly endless radio airtime that "Sex On Fire" got, for reasons I can't begin to fathom. I didn't like that tune the first time I heard it, and the next 500+ times just further solidified my belief. Luckily, Kings Of Leon are good for more than one shitty radio hit. Their style isn't hard or abrasive, it's laid back. A lot of times I dig laid back music because something in it drives you to lay back with it. However, I don't really feel it much with these guys, for some reason. Maybe it's his voice, I don't know. But I am happy to report that not one track on here sounded like "Sex On Fire." Thank God.

**Listen to it if:** you like family bands, like Oasis and the Jackson 5.

**Memorable Tunes:** King Of The Rodeo. They've got some interesting lyrics here, as well as the closest to rapping I've ever heard a southern rock band attempt.
