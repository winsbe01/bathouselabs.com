title: Imogen Heap -- Speak For Yourself
category: music
---

Imogen Heap holds the very unique (and, one might say, privileged) position of a (non-hip-hop) artist who's music is highly electronically processed, yet who's musicianship and compositions I regard as not only well laid out, but as a positive addition to my library. I'm not usually one for musicians who's music sounds more like sparks than vibrations. Come on nerds, you know what I'm saying. The first song of hers I heard was Hide and Seek, an absolutely georgeous, albeit trippy and heart-wrenchingly depressing, song that appears halfway through this album. I heard it as the music to a very powerful dance, and the two mediums lifted each other into an incredible performance, more so than either could do alone. Remembering that song, I had high hopes for this album.

Luckily for everyone involved (i.e. me, Imogen if she ever reads this/cares, neither of which will happen), the album was fantastic. While Hide and Seek is definitely still a stand-out track, it isn't the only gem this record contains. Her tantalizing voice and poetic lyrics make her music an absolute pleasure to listen to. An experience, if you will.

**Listen to it if:** you dislike electronica but have an open mind.

**Memorable Tunes:** Headlock. Not only is it a beautiful start to the album, but it also demonstrates how powerful *silence* is in music. While the music never cuts out completely, each instrument is used sparingly, but together add up to a full, strong sound.
