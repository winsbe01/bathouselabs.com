Oh, this tension, it pulls at my brain-bits.

Just this evening, I crossed a milestone. I have written 25,000 words of a concrete, fictional story. Twenty five thousand words. Just hearing that phrase in my head, twenty five thousand words, feels an awful lot like a huge sack of bricks dropping from nowhere onto me like I took a wrong turn somewhere and walked onto a Monty Python set.

I can't say I'm not proud of myself, as it's a whole bucket full of words I have that I didn't have in October. Wait, yes I can. I'm impressed, sure, but not Satisfied.

You see, the goal this month, [as you may remember][nanopost], is 50,000 words, so this marks only the halfway point in the novel. Those of you who are math savvy may notice that today is the eighteenth day of the month, and Thirty Days Hath November, so I've fallen behind. Twenty five thousand words, and *I'm losing.*

Depressing, I know.

I do have some fantastic excuses, though, which totally make up for it (right?). I had guests over for a pre-Thanksgiving Thanksgiving dinner, and I volunteered to cook the turkey. As I found out, thanks to Mama Winston and Father Google, preparing a turkey has an awful lot to do with pulling things out of and putting things into a bird's ass, something I wouldn't think would become associated with such a popular tradition. Needless to say, transforming the poor animal from a cold, slippery carcass rife with disease into a warm, buttery carcass thankfully absent of the aforementioned disease dried up a lot of my motivation to write. Or maybe it was my friends. Or the gin. Hmm.

Anyways, despite my arsenal of Perfectly Legitimate Excuses, the fact is I'm still behind and it sucks. I'm supposed to hit 30k today, and I'm cringing at the thought of pushing for 26.

What's impressive (read: probably stupid) about this whole process is every one of the 25,000ish words has been written either on a typewriter or by hand. So I have a lovely stack of 40 single-sided pages with quarter-inch or so margins filled with word vomit that I'm sure will make lovely kindling someday. It's nice to have something physical to hold at the end of each writing session: I wrote *this* much today (holds up pathetic sheet or two). My fingers sure do hurt though. And it's loud, so my neighbors probably hate me. It's also a lot slower than typing on a computer. Other complaints too, probably.

While I have made it to the halfway point by manual process alone, I'm not sure how much longer that venture will continue. I'm traveling for Thanksgiving, and I'm not sure what the TSA's stance is on typewriters. I could always continue to write by hand, but not only is that even slower than the typewriter, I also have miserable handwriting.

Have I complained enough yet? Good.

I am just getting tired of writing during all my free time, I guess. I miss Netflix. I'd like to edit what I have because I'm sure it's terrible. I don't have a concrete idea of how to get from this midpoint in the story to the ending (or how the ending will even play out), and having to "make shit up" (technical term) for 25,000 words sounds daunting and damn near impossible.

Do you have any motivation for me? Would you like to read chapter 1? [I'd love to hear from ya][email].
