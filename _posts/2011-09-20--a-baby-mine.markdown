a baby, mine, cries out from down the hall <br />
emerging from the softest arms of sleep <br />
alone, afraid, his daddy a shrill call <br />
away. his bear curled limp by naked feet,

i bring it to his face for him to kiss <br />
and hold, then drift back into a soft snooze. <br />
this boy, softly beautiful breathing, his <br />
round eyes shut, calm now, body limp and loose.

how odd to be scared of this quiet night <br />
when true ghosts and demons lay patient, wait- <br />
ing for the tide of understanding light <br />
to wash over him, to choke their fresh bait.

how cruel the world that lies beyond his crib. <br />
the worst, me, protector, who let him live.
