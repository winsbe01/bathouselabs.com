When I was a kid, Linkin Park was my favorite band of all time. I used to be a swimmer, and if you've ever been a swimmer, you know there's a lot of down time at swim meets. I used to bring my blue (slightly broken) Sony Walkman to the pool and listen to *Hybrid Theory* on repeat. I did this for at least a couple seasons, and I probably listened to the album at least 3 times each meet, so in total, I probably heard that album in its entirety somewhere around 150 times within the span of a year. Needless to say, I was in love with them.

When *Meteora* came out, I bought the special edition and played it in my trusty Walkman a multitude of times as well. It didn't get spun as much as its younger sibling, but it got its fair share of plays. I didn't have the same connection as I did with *Hybrid Theory,* a connection I have rarely felt in my short time on this planet. By the time *Minutes to Midnight* came out and I heard the radio singles, I just wasn't as excited about Linkin Park anymore, having moved on to bigger and better things.

That was years ago, and this is really the first time I've listened to *Minutes To Midnight* as an album. Do I regret the wait? No. As I suspected when I was a wee tot, this album couldn't get a grip on my musical tastes as *Hybrid Theory* did, and connected with me even less than *Meteora* did. Is it a bad album? No, but considering Linkin Park's discography, they peaked early and have been riding the downward trend for some time.

**Listen to it if:** you know > 90% of the words to every song on *Hybrid Theory.* Even if this album doesn't come close, the Linkin Park feel is comforting and reminiscent of the innocent days of yore.

**Memorable Tunes:** The Little Things Give You Away. This is a powerful song with a big sound. I think it's a great way to end an album.
