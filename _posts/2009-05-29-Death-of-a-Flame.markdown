When life begins, a single spark <br />
Jumps out to kiss a piece of bark <br />
And steadily, there comes a light <br />
That splits the shadows from the dark.

The timbers wince at cinders' flight; <br />
A new disruption of the night.

And as it's stretched beyond its means, <br />
The monster drives into the dreams <br />
Of Man.  This creature must be saved <br />
Despite the death of luscious greens.

And with this thought, the crackling craved <br />
The care of Human Man enslaved.

But though he once stood strong and bold, <br />
Even the devil's child gets old <br />
And as the ash o'ertakes the brush, <br />
The passionate heat succumbs to cold. <br />

The fire's mortal life is such <br />
Like that which only God can touch.
