Although I've failed to update this site in the last week or so, I thought I'd publicly announce something, if only to find public shame for not finishing, and using that factor as a motivator for forward progress.

I'm going to write a 50,000 word novel in the 30 days of November.

Ahem. Have you heard of [NaNoWriMo][nano]? It is a worldwide event held every year that declares November to be National Novel Writing Month. Writers both seasoned and aspiring hunker down over laptops, smartphones, legal pads, and Moleskin notebooks to each write 50,000 words of fiction in 30 days.

*Why the hell...?*

The event was created for people who've always wanted to "one day" write a novel. If you're a procrastinator like me, you realize that "one day" can quickly become never. So why not do it *today?* Why not do it in the next 30 days?

If you're thinking that writing 50,000 words in 30 days is *impossible*, it's not. Extremely difficult, yes, but not impossible. 50,000 *great* words is another story, of course. It's understood that in the sheer volume of writing you produce, it won't be perfect (probably not by a long shot). It might not be a cohesive storyline, or maybe you didn't realize the novel you *really* wanted to write until you were 30,000 words in. But you will have written some things that, when you read them back, will make you say "Damn, *I* wrote that." And with a little luck, a lot of editing, and the confidence that comes with the ability to write 50,000 words, your novel can become something wonderful. Something you can show people with pride.

It can make you feel like you actually *did* something with your life. I'm betting that's a damn good feeling.

So, I'm going to give it a shot. What do I have to lose? Right now, before I've even written a word of the story, I've got note cards with scenes, plot points, and character descriptions on them littered across my kitchen table. I've spent the better part of two days studying how other authors have taken an idea and turned it into a successful book. I'm learning all about the writing process, and it's already worth it.

But learning can only take you so far. Eventually, you've gotta just jump off the ledge and into the pool. Even if the water looks suspiciously like lava.

As a result, this site will most likely be a quiet place for the next few weeks. I'll try to check in occasionally with updates and word counts (it will probably be a relief to write something other than my story for half an hour), but I make no guarantees.

Wish me luck! If you have any inspiring or encouraging words, please don't hesitate to [get in touch][email]!

P.S. I'm going to try typing most of this novel on [my typewriter][typewriter] (much like I do with these blog posts -- surprise!)

P.P.S. Without this sentence, this post is just shy of 500 words. So, imagine 100 of these posts. Woah.
