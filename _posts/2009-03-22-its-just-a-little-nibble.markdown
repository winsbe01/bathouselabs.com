it’s just a little nibble, just a wee 
bite, dead skin in the click of the clipper.
no nails, no yells, just white-to-red whimper
sick smirk and display for all to come see

like an open stage, my damp eyes flicker
and flutter like moths about flame, to light
dry paper wings, and fall from gentle flight
to wet grass, and i’m left here to snicker

and leak, like the spring sky.  i, like a tree,
drink and swell the juices, grow strong timber
and stretch; but sometimes, to keep branches straight,
i must prune, and let drop the dry dead weight
that hangs from my hands, pulling down heavy
and strong, that i may stand, and not linger.
