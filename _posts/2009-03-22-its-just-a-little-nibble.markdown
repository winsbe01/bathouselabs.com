it’s just a little nibble, just a wee <br />
bite, dead skin in the click of the clipper. <br />
no nails, no yells, just white-to-red whimper <br />
sick smirk and display for all to come see

like an open stage, my damp eyes flicker <br />
and flutter like moths about flame, to light <br />
dry paper wings, and fall from gentle flight <br />
to wet grass, and i’m left here to snicker

and leak, like the spring sky.  i, like a tree, <br />
drink and swell the juices, grow strong timber <br />
and stretch; but sometimes, to keep branches straight, <br />
i must prune, and let drop the dry dead weight <br />
that hangs from my hands, pulling down heavy <br />
and strong, that i may stand, and not linger.
