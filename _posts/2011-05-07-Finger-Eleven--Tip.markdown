I liked this album a lot more than I thought I was going to. After hearing Paralyzer on the radio around 800 times, I thought that was their style: a hard-rock meets dance-y techno type thing. It works for that song (minus the lyrics -- those are terrible), but I don't think I could take a full album of it. Luckily, this is an album that came out before they hit the mainstream, so it's less saturated with the bullshit popular music shoves into a creative artist's psyche. They have a lot of songs that are not in standard 4/4, which is awesome. I really admire (rock) bands who can do this, as it makes a song stand out from millions of their repetitive peers. One group who does this well is Soundgarden, and it's immediately who I thought of when I heard these songs. Their sound is a bit different, but I enjoyed it just as much.

**Listen to it if:** you thought Finger Eleven was crappy. You might be surprised.

**Memorable Tunes:** Quicksand. It's the first cut on the record, and it made me realize that this album wasn't going to be what I expected.
