There are some bands out there that have an immense effect on people. Some people will hate them with every fiber of their being for reasons they might find hard to verbalize; other people will love the band *so much* that they would actually *kill* someone who dare speak wrongly of the Best Band Ever. Radiohead is one of these bands, and for the sake of my own life and limb, I say to the second group: I totally love Radiohead, now please lower your firearm.

*In Rainbows* is...quite the album. There's an awful lot of...sound. I'm at a bit of a loss for words to describe it. I've clearly not taken enough drugs to fully understand it.

However (and this is a big however), I really did like it. It's not the kind of album where individual songs stand out, screaming *Put me on the radio!* (of course, if you're familiar with Radiohead, this isn't a surprise), nor is it the kind of album where you have "filler songs." It is a whole piece of art in its own right. A very trippy, mysterious, creepy-melody-laden piece of art, but art nonetheless.

**Listen to it if:** you understand that *the album* is an individual, not just the songs (think Pink Floyd).

**Memorable Tunes:** Nude. This built up like chamber music to a swelling, exciting climax. What other modern rock band can do that?
