This album serves as a turning point in the Fab Four's career, transitioning them from pop stars writing peppy love songs to infamous rock gods, drug-addled and writing musically interesting (yet depressing and abstract) songs destined to be performed, quoted, and admired the world over.

History has made it hard to separate *Rubber Soul* from its younger brother, *Revolver.* It's easy for any listener to recognize the tonal and sonic differences between *Revolver* and an early Beatles effort (like *Please, Please Me*). However, the changes in *Rubber Soul*, subtle though they may be, serve as the real jumping off point into the signature and celebrated sound of The Beatles' later albums.

Throughout this album, there are songs whose feel is in tune with The Beatles' early discography, but whose subject matter takes a sharp, often macabre turn. It's not all smiles and love anymore, though you'd never know it from the sound alone. You really need to hear the lyrics to realize the shift in tone. 

They do this duality extremely well, too -- songs like Run For Your Life have their signature bouncy sound, but feature terrifying lyrics. (SPOILER ALERT, the narrator threatens to kill his girlfriend if he discovers her cheating. Yeah, heavy, I know. Reminds me of an early draft of Maxwell's Silver Hammer, but more personal).

**Listen to it if:** when someone asks you "Early Beatles or late?", you hesitate.

**Memorable Tunes:** Girl. Fun fact: John Lennon has been quoted saying that Girl was one of his best songs. Another fun fact: the first time I heard this song was when what's-his-face was singing it a cappella on the teaser trailer for *Across The Universe.* I loved it immediately (and why not?), so I *had* to find it. This was before I was a full-fledged Beatles fan, so the music I had was a greatest hits collection on cassette tapes. So I skipped around through the tapes to find it, and when I did, I had it on repeat for probably an hour. (You may remember...or not...that "repeat" is hard to do on a cassette player). 

Bonus fun fact: *Across The Universe* came out in 2007. What the hell was I doing with a cassette player?
