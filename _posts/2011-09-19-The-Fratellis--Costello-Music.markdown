I'm going to begin this review with a story (as I am wont to do).

A long time ago, in a suburban basement far, far away, a young man of 16 sat behind an ancient drum set, banging away at the warped heads. The kit was bought from a neighbor for $50, and the more the young man played it, the more he wondered if it was worth *half* as much. But that didn't matter, really, because now he was getting a chance to play it for real; him and a group of friends from guitar class (yes, there was an actual guitar class in his high school) decided to play at the monthly coffeehouse concert the town held for the young'ns to keep them off drugs and such (with mild success). They had a bassist, a plethora of guitarists (too many, probably), a few singers, but no drummer. "Hey, *I* have a kit in my basement!" this young man informed them, and they had it: a band.

Of course, the band decided to play this show only a few days before the show was being held (there is no other way to live life than by the seat of your pants, I suppose). They practiced the songs they were going to play during guitar class: mostly popular cover songs, and a fantastic original or two. As the guitarists got more comfortable with the songs, our young friend began feeling anxious, but nonetheless confident. *Yeah, I'm not exactly a drummer,* he (probably) mused to himself, *but I'm very familiar with these songs, and they're all basically 4/4.* Right at this relaxing moment, a suggestion for a cover song was agreed upon: a song called Flathead by (none other than) The Fratellis.

This young man listened to the group begin to play the song (they all knew it, of course, but he had never even *heard* of The Fratellis), and he was really digging it. It really is a catchy, exciting song! The verse was jumpy and exciting, and he couldn't wait for what the chorus might bring.

Oh. Oh, no. [What the hell time signature is that?][1]

But what could a young man do? He had to find a recording of the song (which wasn't as easy as the link above may lead you to believe -- this was 2006 *maybe*, around a year after YouTube was invented). After all, he had faith in his own musical skills (this was before he grew into his cynicism), and he didn't want to let the band down. So he listened to the song. And listened. And once or twice more for good measure. Then to the kit to practice.

After about an hour or so (before he was really prepared), some bandmates came over to practice some songs on the set list with the drums. They set up their instruments (crappy electric ones, versus the crappy acoustic ones they played in class), tuned, and got down to jamming. They went through the classics: songs that were among the first they learned when they first picked up a guitar (Californication comes to mind, among others). Then they got to Flathead. Our friend was nervous and excited all at once (it was a lot of fun to play and hear, after all).

They played it through once, and choked during the chorus. A second time, another error. A third, a fourth. While each person could play the song themselves, putting it all together proved to be a difficult task, and it was decided the best course of action was to scrap it.

Pity. They might have been able to bring it together and rock the house. Although, even without Flathead, they played a fantastic show; everyone on stage had *fun* playing songs they loved, something that serious bands can often forget to strive for under the pressure of success.

...Anyways, Flathead is on this album. I (er, he?) still love this song, and the entire album is just as fun and energetic as this tune. Worth a listen.

**Memorable Tunes:** Whistle For The Choir (What?! After that whole damn story, it's *not* Flathead?). This song is a little more laid back than a lot of the songs on the album, but its chords and vocals are very well orchestrated. It just makes me happy listening to it.
