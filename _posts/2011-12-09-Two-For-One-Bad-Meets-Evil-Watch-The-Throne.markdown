title: Two For One -- Bad Meets Evil and Watch The Throne
category: music
---

Prologue: I was going to write this post about Walk The Throne and link back to the post I wrote back in July about Bad Meets Evil. Unfortunately, whilst moving from [Wordpress][wordpress] to [Jekyll][jekyll], the older post was tossed into a "drafts" folder and never made it back to the blog. I just read it, though, and it sucked pretty hard. So, since I wanted to talk about these two groups in the context of one another, I guess I (you?) got pretty lucky. So...action!

This has been quite the year for music, and hip-hop in particular. Since November 2010, we've been blessed with [Nicki Minaj's][nicki] debut album (after countless features in Top 40 hits), Lil Wayne's *Tha Carter IV* (which I haven't heard...was it good?), and Kanye's *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy* (which I **have** heard, and totally merits a post of its own), among dozens of other gems. In addition to these great solo releases, we also got two pairs of fantastic rappers to team up and release killer albums.

The first, Bad Meets Evil, is comprised of the killer duo Eminem and Royce da 5'9". People who are avid fans of Slim Shady's early work may recognize Royce as the artist featured on Em's first album in the song titled, er, "Bad Meets Evil." This song, IMHO, is one of (if not **the**) best track on *The Slim Shady LP.* At the end of the track, ONE OF THEM says "See you in Hell for the sequel," a hint that they were going to team up again. Unfortunately, due to some bad blood between the two, their reunion didn't come for over a decade. However, during those years both Em and Royce matured greatly in their style and flow, and they came up with a whole album's worth of songs instead of just one.

When I first heard about the album, I was extremely excited. I hadn't heard they were working together until I saw a magazine with them together on the cover. I skimmed the article where I learned about the album, pulled out the old 'droid, fired up the AmazonMP3 app and bought this album on the spot. However, while it does kick some serious ass, it's definitely not the same as their first song together. 

I've tracked Em's career through the high times (*The Marshall Mathers LP*) and the low times (*Relapse*) and today, his flow is much different than it was back then. On this album and on his previous solo effort *Recovery,* his raps seem to be very rigid. It used to feel like he was just behind the beat, kinda leaning back on it, and it made his songs feel very bouncy (which I highly enjoyed). Now, he's dead on the beat, often spitting tons of words very quickly to the point where you have no idea what he's saying. And, love you to death Em, but it doesn't do it for me the same way. Busta's got that market pretty cornered.

Royce, on the other hand, has honed his skills to near perfection. Ninety-nine percent of the time, his lyrics are *spot on* with the feel of the song, and his flow is liquidy and dense. He, dare I say, nearly takes the cake from Em here, or at least puts himself on a level playing field.

Watch The Throne came onto the scene just a few months after Bad Meets Evil, and it features the extremely talented Jay-Z and Kanye West. These guys have worked together for years now; Kanye's career took off as a producer for Jay-Z and other artists on Jay's label, Roc-a-fella Records. Jay and Kanye have also featured each other on their own album tracks, most recently Jay-Z's appearence in multiple tracks on Kanye's *MBDTF.*

Jay-Z kills it on this album, though I expected nothing less. He's been knocking 'em dead since his first record; why should he stop now? Kanye does well, too, but despite how amazing *MBDTF* was, Jay-Z kinda knocks him on his ass on this record, though I'm assuming it's not on purpose. Kanye started out as a producer and expanded his breadth to rapping as well. Jay-Z started out as, well, a crack dealer, which might nullify my argument. But since his start in the music industry, it's been on the business end of a microphone. Incidentally, if you've been following the news, you'll realize he's been doing his duty on the business end of Beyonce as well. And for that, I give him a highly jealous and respected salute.

But I digress.

The first time I heard of Watch The Throne was through a more traditional medium than a random magazine cover; I heard *Otis* on the radio in the car on the way home. If you haven't heard that song, [it's fantastic][otis], and if you follow the link you'll understand why it piqued my interest. The album was expensive at 10 or 11 dollars on AmazonMP3, and since I wouldn't [steal a car][psa], I didn't get the chance to hear it until recently, when it went on sale for $5.

I was expecting wonders. On my first listen through, I certainly did not get wonders. *Otis* was above and beyond any other track on the album in terms of lyricism, beat, and general likeability. It was a disappointment, and I gave myself a pat on the back for waiting for the price to drop. But after writing it off as a missed opportunity for two fantastic rappers to come together and really *tear shit up,* so to speak, I wanted to listen again.

"But Ben," I told myself, probably in some inane voice that hopefully(?) existed solely in my head, "you already listened and decided it wasn't very good." 

"Yes," I retorted, "but something's telling me to give it a second chance."

So I did give it a second listen, against my own will. Then I gave it a third, and a fourth. By now, I've probably listened to it a dozen times, and it really *connects* with me, for some reason I'm having trouble understanding. I can pinpoint a few songs on the album I really do like. I can also point out a significant number that I don't particularly care for, and yet, I've not been skipping them when playing the album. For some reason, the whole of the album is greater than the sum of the tracks.

Now, you must be wondering. *Ben, which was better? Which shall I download and get freaky to?* (By the way, "you" are stereotypically British in this scenario. I don't get it either). To be honest, I'm not sure. They each have redeeming qualities that put them above the competition. Watch The Throne's album as a whole really resonates with me, while Royce totally kills it on each of the Bad Meets Evil tracks.

So what do you do? [Buy][bme] them [both][wtt], enjoy, then cross your fingers that these aren't one off albums, that both groups will come back together for another record. Hell, maybe we'll even see a duo record from Weezy and Drake. One can hope, right?
