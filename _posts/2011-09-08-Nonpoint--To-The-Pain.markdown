This album was quite enjoyable, I thought. It's pretty heavy, with a fair amount of
yelling and drop-D rumbling guitars. The vocalist, though, is very interesting to me, 
because he has a rap-type feel to his lyrics, but it's not matched with a typical hip-hop beat.
This isn't a new idea, rap + metal, but usually the beat is more hip-hoppy, even if 
the instruments are still their same metal selves. This doesn't do that route, but
*it totally works*. Go figure. I always like to hear people trying new things in music,
and get especially excited when it sounds good.

**Listen to it if:** you like metal but don't hate hip-hop, or you're interested in seeing
metal interpreted in another way.

**Memorable Tunes:** Alive And Kicking. This song reminded me of Linkin Park during the 
chorus (which I consider a good thing, although you may not). I think it was the combination
of the chord sounds with the lyrical resolutions that gave me that feel, because besides this song's sound, the
two bands are extremely different. It was a neat feeling, though.
