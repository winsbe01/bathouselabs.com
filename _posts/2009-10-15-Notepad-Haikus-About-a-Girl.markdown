She sends me on waves, <br />
Like the warm, sweet Atlantic, <br />
Of unmatched delight.

~

I thought I knew the <br />
Sun, and how to avoid clouds. <br />
Today, the world, it shines.

~

One breath from her lips, <br />
The last thing I wish to feel <br />
Before the skies fall.

~

One hundred thousand, <br />
More, it will take to hold me <br />
Back from kissing her.
