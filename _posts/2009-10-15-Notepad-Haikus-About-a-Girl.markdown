She sends me on waves,
Like the warm, sweet Atlantic,
Of unmatched delight.

*

I thought I knew the
Sun, and how to avoid clouds.
Today, the world, it shines.

*

One breath from her lips,
The last thing I wish to feel
Before the skies fall.

*

One hundred thousand,
More, it will take to hold me
Back from kissing her.
