[As I mentioned][rok] the other day, I've been on a bit of a Queens of the Stone Age bender recently. And by recently, I mean for the past eight months or so. It's really kind of a problem. Anyways, I thought I better clarify myself; it's not so much a Queens bender as it is a Josh Homme bender. Mr. Homme (which may be pronounced "uomm" like the French, or "homie" like the...English?) is the lead singer/guitarist, primary songwriter, and the only permanent member of Queens. I've become an avid fan of his unique style, and have listened to and enjoyed all five of Queens' studio albums as well as Them Crooked Vultures, a supergroup featuring Homme on guitars and vocals, Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones on bass, and Dave Grohl of Nirvana and Foo Fighters on drums. (Incidental side note: Grohl played drums on *Songs for the Deaf,* one of the more popular Queens of the Stone Age albums). So, with all this Homme love going on, it was only a matter of time before I made my way around to Kyuss, Homme's first band and the group which pioneered the "stoner rock" genre.

I had huge hopes for this album, but it wasn't quite what I was expecting (which [seems to be][drake] [a theme][kol]). The first thing that struck me about the music was the vocals. My first thought, stupidly enough, was "Gee, Josh's voice sure changed a lot between Kyuss and QotSA." After applying logic, something which apparently comes in fits and spurts for me, I realized it wasn't Josh singing at all, but someone with a much less musical and interesting voice. It's not bad, per se, but it was an unfortunate surprise because a large part of my love for Homme's music is how interesting his voice is and how well he weaves it into his guitar work. I was so taken off guard that for the first few listens, I wrote the album off entirely, not able to get past the vocalist's whine coming through the speakers when my brain was expecting Homme's sugary-smoothness.

Luckily, I was finally able to coax myself to listen past the singer to the music behind it. And there it was: the essence of the music I've come to love through Homme's discography. The music itself is hard to describe; it features lots of repetition, heavy guitars, and well placed, musically interesting licks. To me, it feels like the music constantly pushes the listener forward, putting them in a trance-like state. Now, I don't know if this is what "stoner rock" is, or if that term is anything beyond some reviewer trying to attach a name to some music they see as different enough to warrant a unique label, but whatever you want to call it, it's fantastic music with an addictive quality unmatched by any other genre.

**Listen to it if:** you love Queens of the Stone Age, Them Crooked Vultures, Foo Fighters' *Wasting Light,* or any kind of music that can get you hyped up.

**Memorable Tunes:** Whitewater. At the very end of this song (an 8+ minute number at the end of the album), the band breaks into a short, difficult to understand tune. My subconscious tells me this song is highly sexual while, at the same time, the language center of my brain reconsiders all the English I've learned and begins to lose it's shit. Really, [you have to hear it][yt] to understand (starts at 8:00).
