You know those bands you love but never commit to? Like, you know who they are, you've heard their popular songs (and even some of their unpopular ones), you recognize their talent and you *like* them, for cryin' out loud, but for some reason, when given the choice, you never put on one of their albums?

Third Eye Blind is that band for me. I've heard their radio hits hundreds of times since I was a kid (and honestly, who hasn't?). I know all the words and sing along (poorly). Heck, one of my favorite songs to play with [my old band][1] during concerts was Semi-Charmed Life.

But have I ever really *committed* to one of their albums? Dug my heels in, tuned out all other distractions and just listened to one record? Quite honestly, no. And it's really a shame. From the few songs and lyrics I've picked up by putting one of their albums on at work (like today) or running across one of their tracks on *Shuffle All* (a dangerous move, with a mixed-bag library like mine), these guys are the real deal: alternative rock at its finest. I only hope to one day find 45 minutes of concentrated relaxation where I can give Third Eye Blind the time it deserves.

**Listen to it if:** you remember being 10 years old and singing along to Jumper on the radio.

**Memorable Tunes:** London. There's feedback in the song! I didn't know TEB ever messed with sound like that; I thought it was more a grunge thing.
