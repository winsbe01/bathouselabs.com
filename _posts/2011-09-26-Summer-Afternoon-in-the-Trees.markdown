It's fully June <br />
in sweltering Georgia <br />
and everything is heavy.

Daisy petals droop, <br />
defeated. Water slinks <br />
away into the ground.

Even the crane flies <br />
hover languidly, nibbling the crust <br />
at the corner of a man's lips.

A spider hangs <br />
from an eyelid, lowering <br />
evenly as an elevator.

Shoelaces dangle softly <br />
like spaghetti. Robins eye them <br />
like worms from their nests.

A deer rambles over <br />
damp leaves, and leans to lap <br />
the blood from her hoof.

This ripe fruit, held up <br />
by a twist of leather, rots <br />
beneath the stifling blanket

of a southern summer. <br />
The deer meanders off <br />
into the trees, perhaps to nap.
