Okay, let me introduce this slowly.

Yes, this is the same Steve Martin who acted in classic movies such as *Roxanne; Planes, Trains, and Automobiles;* and *Cheaper by the Dozen.*

He wrote all the songs on the album, music and lyrics.

He plays banjo.

He's *very good* at banjo.

The album features such supporting talent as the Steep Canyon Rangers (the band he plays with regularly), the Dixie Chicks (who, apparently, still make music), and Paul McCartney (yeah, *that* Paul McCartney).

The album is a follow up to another Steve Martin solo album, *which won a grammy.*

Wow, right?

It's a fantastic bluegrass album, and also a testament to a man with seemingly endless talent. I enjoyed the music as much as I enjoyed recognizing the man who was making it from something *other* than music. What an incredible artist.

**Listen to it if:** you thought Steve Martin was just a hack. Well, he's not, hater.

**Memorable Tunes:** Athiests Don't Have No Songs. It's an a capella tune about athiests' unfortunate lack of songs, verses the vast library of religious songs. It's hilarious, first of all. It's also an extremely talented a capella mix. (Note: Steve, while he's proven himself in so many other mediums, is not a very good singer. Sorry Steve.).
