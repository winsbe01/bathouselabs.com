Greetings friends and viewing public.

I'm writing this little note from deep in the throes of the infamous Week Two of [NaNoWriMo][nano]. It is common knowledge among this subculture of arguably insane people that days eight through fourteen are the toughest, rough and tumble days of this whole month long word binge. And since a metric butt-ton of people can't be wrong, much to my dismay, history is proving itself once again.

Week One went well -- surprisingly well, in fact. If any of you know me in a non-digital context, you're surely aware of my propensity to begin things with a great rush of enthusiasm, only to lose it as quickly and suddenly as it came. Since this has happened on more than a dozen occasions, I was expecting the desire to cut and run from the novel to hit me early on. Alas, it did not, and I closed out the week with around 13,000 words, well on track to meet the 50,000 word goal by the end of November to "win".

But with the good news comes the bad. Although I know where my story must go next, even down to fairly specific details surrounding the next few scenes, I just *don't want to write them.* Which is a super mature thing to say, isn't it? Can't you imagine me sitting at my typewriter, my bottom lip as pouty as I can make it, slapping the keys angrily until all the hammers get tangled up in a big metal mess? **I DON'T WANNA!**

Ahem.

I guess there's comfort in knowing that nearly everyone who's out there Nano-ing along with me is throwing the same tantrum. (Except those fuckers who reached 50,000 words in hours or days. Seriously, screw you guys.) 

There's also comfort in knowing that I *do* know where the story is going next, where it *has* to go. It's easy to get caught up in the romantic notion of setting your characters loose on the page, letting them fart around at will for 50,000 words. This isn't something I could conceivably pull off, as I'm having enough trouble getting them from point A to point B *when I know the goddamn path.* I do like to let my characters stretch their legs, though, and sometimes they get interesting bring something new to the story, something I hadn't consciously planned. They're discovering the details of this fictional world, which will ultimately be what makes the story real enough to believe and strong enough to pull a reader in.

I mean, that's what writing's all about, right?
