I’ve never been a man of common prose <br />
For this I blame O’Hara and his sly <br />
Wit, so as these fiction authors fly <br />
I’m stuck forever in this fetal pose

Wingless, waiting for this ink to dry <br />
And fill your mouth with raw and sour taste <br />
Of emotion, of rhythm drained to waste <br />
In puddles, like the giggles that you cry.

Do I, a poor poet, tend to make haste <br />
By pouring feelings quicker than you drink <br />
To make you choke, and cough, and cry, and think <br />
These thoughts your soakèd mind had now embraced?

I don’t believe a poem a simple shrink <br />
'Cause fifteen thousand words is far too few <br />
For me to do what I intend to do <br />
In sixteen lines of salty tear-drop blinks.
