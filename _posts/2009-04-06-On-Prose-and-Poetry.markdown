I’ve never been a man of common prose
For this I blame O’Hara and his sly
Wit, so as these fiction authors fly
I’m stuck forever in this fetal pose

Wingless, waiting for this ink to dry
And fill your mouth with raw and sour taste
Of emotion, of rhythm drained to waste
In puddles, like the giggles that you cry.

Do I, a poor poet, tend to make haste
By pouring feelings quicker than you drink
To make you choke, and cough, and cry, and think
These thoughts your soakèd mind had now embraced?

I don’t believe a poem a simple shrink
'Cause fifteen thousand words is far too few
For me to do what I intend to do
In sixteen lines of salty tear-drop blinks.
