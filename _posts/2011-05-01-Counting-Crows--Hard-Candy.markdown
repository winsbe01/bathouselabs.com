Now, let me make something clear for you. I am not a country boy. I think cowboy hats are stupid to wear unless, ya know, you're a cowboy. I'm also aware of who won the Civil War. (It was the North, for those of you who don't know. Yes, you, South Carolina). That being said, this album seems as though it's trying to be country, but not quite getting it, like a man who chews straw and uses poor grammar while stuck in rush-hour traffic in his Prius. The songs on the record all sound very similar, so if you dig track one, you're good to go. Not for me, though.

**Listen to it if:** you think you're pretty country because you watched a Jeff Foxworthy special on TV once.

**Memorable Tunes:** Carriage. The saxophone solo was a nice touch. Oh, and the bonus track at the end of the album. It's a Springsteen cover, I believe, and I'm not even gonna touch that right now.
