these blank souls suck the marrow from sick bones
empty bodies are built from, sitting dry,
idle beneath burnt skin and pale, with wry
humor in upheaval of all meals shown

by reluctant hairnet mice, who would die
than give pennies or thoughts to wasted glares
on Sunday mornings, nightly crooked stares
by clowns who dress in yes-names, noses high

nostrils flaring, their eyes like putrid stones
in strawberry-vanilla slits, thinned by
stark lighting, their darkened, stiff, well-placed hair,
still drowsy from the eveningâ€™s loud affair
droops downward toward the coffee coughs and groans
from wax-winged boys who soar blind in the sky.
