these blank souls suck the marrow from sick bones <br />
empty bodies are built from, sitting dry, <br />
idle beneath burnt skin and pale, with wry <br />
humor in upheaval of all meals shown

by reluctant hairnet mice, who would die <br />
than give pennies or thoughts to wasted glares <br />
on Sunday mornings, nightly crooked stares <br />
by clowns who dress in yes-names, noses high

nostrils flaring, their eyes like putrid stones <br />
in strawberry-vanilla slits, thinned by <br />
stark lighting, their darkened, stiff, well-placed hair, <br />
still drowsy from the eveningâ€™s loud affair <br />
droops downward toward the coffee coughs and groans <br />
from wax-winged boys who soar blind in the sky.
