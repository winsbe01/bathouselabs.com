In case you haven’t heard, Netflix made a change to their rental plans today. If you have heard, then I’m sure you’re aware of the incredible outrage among movie-lovers nationwide, many of whom [posted scathing remarks][1] on the company’s blog post.

In essence, the new plan splits up the company’s two arenas -- internet streaming and DVDs-by-mail -- into separate plans instead of bundling them together.

But DVDs are so 2001! you might say. Why would someone not use streaming?

Well, let’s see.

 1. **Broadband speeds.** Yes, our internet speed and availability isn’t up to snuff compared to other developed countries around the world. This isn’t Netflix’s problem, this is an infrastructure problem, and beyond the scope of this post.
 2. **Movies missing from streaming.** Some movies are available on DVD only, and it’s more than you might think. In my list of movies to watch (~200 films ATM) only 30-40% are available to stream.

Netflix’s move, which breaks off unlimited 1-at-a-time DVDs into its own plan, is beneficial for someone without access to an internet connection fast enough to handle streaming movies. Under the old plan, DVDs were an add-on to the streaming service, so these people were, in effect, paying for a service they could not use. This, as you can imagine, is not fair to them.

Now, what about all those movies missing from streaming? Many people (myself included) receive DVDs in addition to the streaming service so we can watch the movies that aren’t available online. This new plan raises our monthly price by $6, which is a hefty increase from $10. But let’s compare this to other services:

 * Redbox: $1/movie/night.
 * Blockbuster: Unlimited 1 movie out at a time for $11.99/month (same at Netflix's DVD-only plan).

Those who rent less than 6 movies/month will turn to Redbox, possibly giving up some selection for lower prices. The rest? Netflix is still the least expensive DVD-by-mail plan out there. Yeah, it’s more expensive now than it was before, but it’s still Number One.

And what will Netflix do with the extra $6/month from those of us (myself included) who will rollover to the new DVD plan? Improve their business, which includes making more movies available to both their streaming and DVD services, appealing to those of us frustrated with their limited online selection.

This new plan may be getting some bad press from users who have enjoyed their remarkably low prices for years. But don’t be fooled -- Netflix made the right choice for them and for us.
