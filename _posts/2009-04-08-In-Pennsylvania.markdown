In Pennsylvania, many mindsets ago, <br />
Many hundred thousand raindrops and skin-flakes ago, <br />
I sat down on a low chair in a small street shop 

To look at a book.  It was a blank day, even the <br />
Old trees that lined the sidewalk began to <br />
Thin and fade into the misty gray sky.

Why I grabbed this book I couldnâ€™t say, but I let the <br />
Hard covers fall flat against my knees to a page <br />
Two-thirds the way through.  A lonely, tree-filled

Graveyard stared up at me, and a man walked, his <br />
Back to the camera.  I looked at this picture intently, <br />
For a minute or so, then closed the book and replaced it

On the shelf.  Since then, I have changed faces and <br />
Changed places many times.  But even now, I would <br />
Give my soul and fruitful years, if only to gaze upon <br />
The turned man, walking quietly away, for one minute more.
