thirty one wet eyes <br />
stuck straight, three <br />
whispers, four silent <br />
snores

one dreams in playbills, two <br />
in norman rockwell paintings <br />
four breathe soft for dead <br />
men

a high chord, low line, mind <br />
with john and paul, sweat beads <br />
fall on keys, a stiff suit <br />
chokes

fingertips tease the tones <br />
from a bandstand grand <br />
black like cash and <br />
deeper
