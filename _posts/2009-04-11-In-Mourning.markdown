*for Emily Rachel Silverstein,
may she find a peace unknown on this earth*

We were strangers, though we lived not thirty
Feet apart.  I would wave to you in stair-
Wells and on sidewalks, and you would smile back
At me.  Now I canâ€™t smile, I just wear black
For you, and bend down to kiss your sturdy
Wood coffin, and curse this whole life unfair.
