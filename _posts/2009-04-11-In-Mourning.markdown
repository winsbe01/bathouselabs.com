*for [Emily Rachel Silverstein][1], <br />
may she find a peace unknown on this earth*

We were strangers, though we lived not thirty <br />
Feet apart.  I would wave to you in stair- <br />
Wells and on sidewalks, and you would smile back <br />
At me.  Now I canâ€™t smile, I just wear black <br />
For you, and bend down to kiss your sturdy <br />
Wood coffin, and curse this whole life unfair.
