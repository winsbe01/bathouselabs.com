At this point, some of you may be wondering, *Why do you do this to yourself? Hoobastank? Really?* And to that, dear friends, I answer, *I don't know! Dear God, why?!*

All non-joking aside, this album was pretty...meh. My ears are bleeding a little bit, but not too bad. I still seem to be alive, but everything suddenly seems...ugly, and gray. My fever's only low-grade, so no need for hospitalization. I do feel sore, though, like my kidneys have suddenly given up and let themselves go, having ice cream for dinner and vodka for breakfast. It kind of feels like I put the *Do Not Remove* label ripped from my mattress along with a fork and a voodoo doll I made of myself in the microwave, then stood in front of it while it the beastly machine shat sparks and radiation and mented my counter into plasma. Basically, the way I felt the first time I heard Gaga's "Just Dance."

**Listen to it if:** Nickelback just doesn't hurt enough anymore.

**Memorable Tunes:** Give It Back. For one, it's the last song, so I was freed at it completion. Also, they started talking about food or something after the music stopped. It was surreal and uncomfortable, and that's really not the way to end an already painful album.
