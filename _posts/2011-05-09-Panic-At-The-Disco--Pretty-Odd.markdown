Panic! and I have had an interesting history. I remember ranting about them in my younger years, criticizing their cookie-cutter style, their Fall-Out-Boy rip-off sound, and their ridiculously stupid name. Well, here I am, a few years later, paying for one of their albums. Go figure.

What got me to buy this one was the radio single (perish the thought), Nine in the Afternoon. I know a fair number of people didn't really like this song, but I thought it was extremely catchy, partially because I was on a Beatles kick at the time. Amazon reviewers had mixed emotions, further emphasizing their efforts to sound like Beatles. Well, although I am a fan of bands embracing their own style, I do love the Beatles, so I wanted to see how accurate these claims were. The verdict? It's not as bad as people make it out to be. I thought Panic! did a good job using later Beatles work (see *Magical Mystery Tour* and *Sgt. Pepper*), in combination with their alt-punk sound, to produce a neat sound throughout the album. It's not something that you would think goes together well, but it works.

**Listen to it if:** you want to know what sort of songs John, Paul, George and Ringo would have come up with if they were doing the Beatles today.

**Memorable Tunes:** I Have Friends In Holy Spaces. It sounds like an old track, which I love. It's got the crackle of a record player, and it's just a classical guitar/ukulele instrument, with some sax/trumpet as well. It's a quick number but, along with the songs mentioned earlier, it connects with its roots more directly than their other tunes, and does it very well.
