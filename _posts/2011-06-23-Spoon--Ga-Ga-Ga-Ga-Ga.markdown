Okay, I know, I just reviewed a Spoon album. I just bought that album recently when Amazon put 1500+ albums on sale for $5 each (how could I not get it and a few others?). This was the first Spoon album I've ever bought, and the first time I heard the band and, to put it lightly, I fell in love. So I had to buy another. I did a quick search to see what album was "the best" (yeah, this is completely subjective, oh well). *Ga^5* was rated really well, so I went with it.

Overall, in my limited exposure to Spoon, I think I liked *Gimme Fiction* better. Before I get flamed by Spoon fans, hear me out. I think the novelty of the band completely entranced me. I had no idea what I was getting into before hearing *Gimme Fiction,* whereas I had pretty high expectations coming into *Ga^5.* I also really liked the spacey feel of the former, whereas this album didn't quite feel as "out there" (I don't always like "out there", but it's been speaking to me lately since my discovery of Radiohead). Just because I didn't like this one as much doesn't mean I'm not going to listen to it again, nor will I write off Spoon as a band. I'm just gettin' started, baby!

**Listen to it if:** I dunno, man, it's good music! Isn't that reason enough?

**Memorable Tunes:** Don't Make Me A Target. Real catchy. Intoxicatingly so. Dope start to the record.
