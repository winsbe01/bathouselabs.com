Yes, I'm serious. Ice T, the badass cop from *Law and Order: SVU.* Back before he was beating up criminals and hanging out with Munch, Ice T lent his talents to the catalog of old-school rap. From his beats and style, he sounds like a mash-up of MC Hammer and Eazy-E. His lyrics are very violent (as he is a gangsta rapper) but, as with Eazy, the poppy late 80's/early 90's beats behind them make it sound less intimidating than, say, modern day Dre or Eminem.

**Listen to it if:** you're a true, hardcore west-coast hip-hop lover, a purist, or would like to know what Fin's dialogue would sound like if *SVU* wasn't on basic cable.

**Memorable Tunes:** The Girl Tried To Kill Me. While they lyrical content itself isn't a change from the rest of the album (Ice T details encounters with a woman who is crazy in the bedroom), the style is much different. It's rock/metal. This is the only song on the album featuring this style, but not the only song in Ice T's career. He actually went on to form a metal band, with him in charge of lyrics and vocals. Crazy, huh?
