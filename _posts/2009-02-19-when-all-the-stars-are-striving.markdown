when all the stars are striving <br />
to silence(ing) the sound <br />
(with you, my love, i’m driving <br />
my head into the ground)

the moon sits softly, calling <br />
his rays in(to) a stream <br />
(with you, my love, i’m falling <br />
apart at every seam)

upon which stars, now frowning, <br />
draw pride from (dark)less fears <br />
(with you, my love, i’m drowning <br />
in pools of my own tears) 

the night, whose loving feeling <br />
falls quickly, (in)to death <br />
(with me, my love, you’re stealing <br />
my every waking breath)
