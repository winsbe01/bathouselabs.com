when all the stars are striving
to silence(ing) the sound
(with you, my love, i’m driving
my head into the ground)

the moon sits softly, calling
his rays in(to) a stream
(with you, my love, i’m falling
apart at every seam)

upon which stars, now frowning,
draw pride from (dark)less fears
(with you, my love, i’m drowning
in pools of my own tears) 

the night, whose loving feeling
falls quickly, (in)to death
(with me, my love, you’re stealing
my every waking breath)
