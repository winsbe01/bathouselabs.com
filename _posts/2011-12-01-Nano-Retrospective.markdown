gist: I did it! Surprise!

November, like every event that has occurred in recorded history, has come and gone. In its wake, it's left fond memories, tough times, and everything in between, including but not limited to several million flocks of turkey carcasses. For those of us living in NaNo Land, November has also left behind huge piles of words, some of which are beautiful and inspiring, the vast majority of which are absolute drivel that wish to distance ourselves from and never speak of again.

*NaNo Land.* Sounds a bit like a theme park, doesn't it? In actuality, it is quite like a theme park: participating in [NaNoWriMo][nnwm] is a lot like leaving planet Earth voluntarily for thirty days to inhabit a place where everything is *extreme.* I'm not just talking about the wordcount: writing 1,667 words a day is the most tame thing about this "contest." It's the emotional highs and lows that really send you for a hellish ride. In NaNo Land, when you're happy you're not just "happy," you feel like a billion kittens playing in a ball pit made entirely out of cotton candy. When you're upset, you're not just "sad," it's as if some evil wizard cast a spell over the ball pit and the kittens morph into clones of Dick Cheney, crawl out chanting [Pachelbel's Canon][pc], and tell you the cotton candy you've been enjoying is flavored primarily with cyanide and the tears of third-world half-starved child laborers who coincidentally died while making the exact clothes you are currently wearing.

You get the gist.

It really is an emotional experience, as I'm sure you can tell by the above terrifying scenario, else the [updates][u1] I've [given][u2] throughout [the month][u3]. At the beginning, I was excited! I managed to get two thousand words ahead! Two thousand! A measly week-and-a-half later and I was over three thousand words *behind,* a pit of despair that seemed impossible to overcome. Even when I (miraculously) caught back up, I didn't want to finish the story. I was over 75% of the way there, and I was ready to pack it in and call it quits! It seems silly looking at it from the Finish Line.

And I can call it the Finish Line because I did indeed cross 50k! On the evening of Tuesday, November 29th (well, about an hour into the 30th, if we're being technical about it), I typed my way through my final scene to the end of the First Draft of this novel. How about some statistics?

 * Total words: 50,063
 * Analog: 34,912 (hand wrote ~3k, typewriter for the rest)
 * Digital: 15,151 ([vim][vl]!)
 * First word: The
 * Last word: orange
 * Most words in one day: between 3 and 4k
 * Least words in one day: zero :(

What have I proven during this crazy escapade? It is possible for me (and you too!) to write a long piece of fiction in a relatively short period of time while still maintaining both a social life and a day job. Also, more generally, it is possible for me to *actually do something I set out to do.* This whole "follow through" thing is foreign to me in my personal and creative endeavors, so this is the most exciting take away.

So what's next, you might ask? Well, writing every day is proving to be quite a nice habit, so I would like to try and keep it up for as long as I can. Not a full 1,667 words each day, though, as my wrist is rather pissed off at me for jumping into a typing marathon without proper training. As is typical for me, while I was focused on my writing this month I got some cool ideas for programs to work on, so I may be tackling that as well. I also began thinking about a story I wrote in college, something that I had considered making into a novel at the time (not seriously, but the idea crossed my mind). I do like the idea still (a lot, in fact), so I think I'll start building out the characters some more, or at least reacquainting myself with them.

*Wait, you're going to write something else?* Uh, yeah. [Pop quiz, hotshot][speed]: young stressed college grad pours his heart and thirty days into 50,000 words of a Shitty First Draft. Does he hate his characters with the force of [Genghis Khan][gk]'s pelvic thrust? Absolutely. I would love to fix it up now (especially the typewriter bit -- [OCR][ocr] has failed me), but I'm too close to the story at this point; I can't be objective. One of two things would happen: either I'd remember how much it hurt writing the story so I'd be hesitant to delete anything (even bad stuff), or I'd be ultra pissed at how much I think it sucks that I'd delete everything (even good stuff). So for now, I'm gonna let it simmer in Dropbox and the desk drawer until the last week of December. Until then, looks like it's time to prepare for the Shitty First Draft of another novel! Forward!
