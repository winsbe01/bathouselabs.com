title: On Asphalt, In April
category: writing
---

The streetlights droop daylight. <br />
My shadow lies in front of me, stretching <br />
like the truth.

Beneath the universe, I'm smaller than a speck of dust- <br />
covered candy on the floor <br />
near a hospital bed, in danger <br />
of crunching and crumbling <br />
beneath scrub-covered slippers.

Black grass curls around the curb, <br />
then rolls away from me <br />
into a line of trees.

On asphalt, in April, <br />
it's hard to imagine myself <br />
as someone's child, someone's likeness. <br />
The wind breathes a cloud- <br />
blanket overhead.

No, I am like the moon: <br />
The full moon, who drains and empties. <br />
The new moon, who's aged into oblivion.
