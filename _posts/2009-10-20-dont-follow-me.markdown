(don't follow me) she said <br />
and i dragged along her coattails <br />
with my nose in the dirt, <br />
breathing in her musky pheromones <br />
like angel dust.

(trust in us) she cooed <br />
and my blisters popped <br />
thick pus into my battle scars, <br />
my feet bruised, head down  <br />
like a servant.

(i love you) she offered <br />
and jumped on a sinking ship <br />
towards Eden, hungry <br />
for an apple, thirsty <br />
for a snake.

(what happened) she asked <br />
six-thousand-miles below, <br />
and me, i scratch at mirrors <br />
and reach for the scars <br />
on my pale face.
