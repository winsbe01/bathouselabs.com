I've always thought of myself as a bit of a Dashboard sucker, but I never really had anything to back that up. I heard a couple of their songs on the radio and enjoyed them, dug their style (sound and songwriting), but that's about it. I will no longer be making that claim. While I still believe their sound is good, and I do enjoy their songs, I cannot listen to 10 of them in a row. It's just like a never-ending void of angst. I feel like I need someone to tell me "It's gonna be okay" after hearing this album.

**Listen to it if:** you're ready to be depressed, or you're a fourteen-year-old girl (in which case you're probably already depressed)

**Memorable Tunes:** This Bitter Pill. The singer actually started yelling at me at the end of the song. But it was like, cry-yelling. Like he was holding back tears (which I'm sure he was, based on his lyrics) but was also super angry. The only other group of people I've heard that type of noise come from is teenage girls.
