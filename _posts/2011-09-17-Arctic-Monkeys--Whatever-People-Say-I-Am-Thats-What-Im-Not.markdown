title: Arctic Monkeys -- Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not
category: music
---

I was very graciously introduced to the Arctic Monkeys a year or so ago when a band I was in at the time decided to play the song Old Yellow Bricks off the album *Favourite Worst Nightmare.* I must admit, while I did enjoy that song, I didn't see the whole hype around the band as a whole. *What hype?* Oh, they're English, so they're pretty hot across the pond. *But all their songs sound the same!* Yeah, I know, that's what I thought too, strangely disembodied voice who might represent a former self.

But the more I've listened to them, the more I realize that the Arctic Monkeys have done the seemingly impossible: they've taken two difficult-to-approach genres, punk rock and indie music, and made something much more enjoyable and *fun* than either parent. Punk rock sounds like punk rock, every time, and indie music, despite all its effort to sound different than the mainstream, always seems to sound like indie music. So yes, the Arctic Monkeys' song library might sound repetitive, but it's an inherited property. It's really more novel than most music written today.

Basically, it's a blast to listen to. Please, get this album (or another of theirs), put it on, and rock out. You owe it to yourself.

**Listen to it if:** you had a dream once where you went to a concert and the headlining band was "Coheed, Cambria and Johnny Ramone".

**Memorable Tunes:** Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secure. This song sounds an awful like I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor, but for some reason, the combination of the headbanging-worthy chorus, the bouncy verses, and the lyrics make this song an absolute knock-out.
