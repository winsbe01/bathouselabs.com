i hatehatehate oh HATE
my skkull
it serves as a dam for my brai(n)
so ffull

each pen i touch time to a
goddamn pad
no thought, no single idea
drips through

there is no crack. no pipe
to sppeak
of(course you can do it of
)course nnot

so i wither away in the puddles
of piss
i drone in place of a
lost ocean
