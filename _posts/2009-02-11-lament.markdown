i hatehatehate oh HATE <br />
my skkull <br />
it serves as a dam for my brai(n) <br />
so ffull

each pen i touch time to a <br />
goddamn pad <br />
no thought, no single idea <br />
drips through

there is no crack. no pipe <br />
to sppeak <br />
of(course you can do it of <br />
)course nnot

so i wither away in the puddles <br />
of piss <br />
i drone in place of a <br />
lost ocean
