Chris Cornell: the Man, the Myth, the Douche who single-handedly created then destroyed two amazing musical groups like some sort of angsty, vengeful God. Chris Cornell's ego is about as big as Chris Cornell would say his cock is: monumental. As in, they've built monuments honoring its magnificence, all of which happen to be in Chris Cornell's backyard. I wouldn't be surprised if he spent most of his days lounging in a hammock hung between two of these monuments.

This being said, the album is pretty good. Not multi-cock-monument good, but good enough to throw a few bucks his way on the strict stipulation that any and all further plans for cock monument construction be terminated immediately.

**Listen to it if:** you like Chris Cornell? I dunno, man, all I can think of now are dick jokes.

**Memorable Tunes:** When I'm Down. Very cool piano at the beginning, both the chords and the tone.
