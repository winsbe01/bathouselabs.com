Gotta say, I'm more than a little disappointed. Drake has two, uh talents, I guess, according to popular opinion. According to *my* opinion (which is the only one that gets out in these posts), one is not so much a talent as an annoyance.

In case you're not familiar with his work, or with hip-hop/R&B in general, let me try and break it down for you. There are two worlds at play here: hip-hop and R&B (duh). Now, I know they often go hand in hand, with R&B songs decorated with rapped verses, and hip-hop tunes featuring some singing in the chorus. Now, Drake uniquely occupies the middle ground between these two genres. No, not *hip-rhythming* or *blues-hopping* (which, incidentally, both sound like fantastic genres). What Drake does instead is both; he can sing *and* rap. So, in some of his songs, the focus is on singing. In others, it's on rapping. He even has the tendency to do both in the same song, which (I suppose) saves the cost/hassle of featuring someone else on the track.

Of course, I can't help but thinking of the opening lines off Hailey's Song off of Eminem's *The Eminem Show:*
> I can't sing.
> I feel like singing.
> I wanna fuckin' sing.
Then, as you probably guessed, Eminem sings. But he gets away with it, in my book, because of these opening lines. See, he acknowledges that he isn't a singer: he's a rapper (and an angry one, at that). However, he wants to try something pretty different, so he warns us. I really appreciate this behavior; it allowed me to listen to the song without constantly wondering, *why the hell is he singing?* I could appreciate it at face value, understand what he was trying to do, then remember *never* to play it again, because I don't drop my hard earned coin to hear Eminem's less-than-stellar singing voice. Sorry Em, but you said it yourself.

These feelings of animosity towards Eminem's singing are exactly what I'm feeling towards Drake. I bought his album to hear him rap, because he's a *goddamn fantastic rapper.* But of course, he had to go and ruin it (for me) by singing on nearly every track, sometimes to the complete exclusion of any rapping whatsoever.

That's just my opinion, take it or leave it. In fact, you should probably leave it because, according to the whole damn world, I'm alone in my thinking. How many freakin' songs out there these days feature Drake and his angelic voice? According to that radio station I listen to in rush hour driving home from work, *every single one of them.* Whatever. I still think his true talent is rapping. Otherwise, I don't know what the hell he's doing hanging out with Weezy so much.

**Listen to it if:** you've listened to the radio in the last 6 months and actually enjoyed what you heard.

**Memorable Tunes:** Thank Me Now. This one hit me (positively) for a few reasons. First, it was the last cut on the album, so I didn't need to worry about how much singing was coming up in the next track. Second, it was a song that really emphasized Drake's fine-tuned skill at rapping. Ya know, the reason I bought the damn album. I guess one-for-fourteen isn't too terrible, right?
