The little boy in overalls
Is staring at the fountain and
It's rising like a mountain and
He watches as the water falls.

He stops, and when his mother calls,
She sees his legs have turned from sand
To stone, and when she grabs his hand,
She finds it strong as ancient walls.

But as he's pulled away, he stalls
To watch the water rise, expand,
And cycle 'round, much like a fan.
His eye it captures, much enthralls.

The fountain, in his mind, installs
A memory, with which he can
Embrace the wonder once again,
As back into routine he falls.
