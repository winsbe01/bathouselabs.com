The little boy in overalls <br />
Is staring at the fountain and <br />
It's rising like a mountain and <br />
He watches as the water falls.

He stops, and when his mother calls, <br />
She sees his legs have turned from sand <br />
To stone, and when she grabs his hand, <br />
She finds it strong as ancient walls.

But as he's pulled away, he stalls <br />
To watch the water rise, expand, <br />
And cycle 'round, much like a fan. <br />
His eye it captures, much enthralls.

The fountain, in his mind, installs <br />
A memory, with which he can <br />
Embrace the wonder once again, <br />
As back into routine he falls.
