It's funny how one song can change an artist's career forever. Like, you could be well respected, consistently putting out good singles and mediocre albums, and then all of a sudden, you agree to do a song with He Who Shall Not Be Named, and no one can take you seriously anymore.

Before this poor decision, though, Luda put out some pretty solid tunes. This album, though it's got a handful of great songs, isn't too strong overall, IMHO. This very well could be my personal tastes; I'm not a fan of the slower, love-oriented rap songs that are closer to an R&B sort-of feel. I don't listen to a rap album to hear these songs. Luda must like 'em, though, cause he's got a fair number of them on this record. Besides these songs, he kills it.

**Listen to it if:** you like both rap and R&B, or you'd like to remember what Luda was like before he lost credibility.

**Memorable Tunes:** Southern Fried Intro. While most intros to rap albums are just a spoken intro, Ludacris takes it a step further. His raps on this track are extremely fast (think Busta Rhymes fast), and his lyrical talent is amazing.
