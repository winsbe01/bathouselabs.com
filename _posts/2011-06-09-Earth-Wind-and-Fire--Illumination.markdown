This is another one of those bands I was misinformed about. Or maybe I have the odd album of their discography. Either way, I knew these guys had an R&B sort of feel, but I was expecting more of a 70s era birth-of-R&B sort-of thing. As you may have guessed, I didn't find this. A variety of artists (many of whom are quite popular) are featured on this album, and the songs they lend their talents to sound like the featured artist's song, not EWF's. This isn't unheard of, nor is it a bad thing, but the number of tracks on the album that featured someone was huge, so it got frustrating after awhile. They're also all newer artists (Big Boi, will.i.am, etc.), so the sound is much more modern than I expected.

**Listen to it if:** you like all sorts of R&B, and don't feel like making a playlist.

**Memorable tunes:** The Way You Move. It's a cover of the Outkast tune of the same name, but hold on. *Featuring Kenny G.* He plays most of the verse parts. I am so dumbstruck by the insanity of this whole scenario, I have no words.
