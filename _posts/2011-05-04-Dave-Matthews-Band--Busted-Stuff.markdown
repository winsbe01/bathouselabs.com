I'm going to start off with a quote from comedian Dan Tosh:
> Dave Matthews Band sucks. If that upsets anybody in here, you're the problem in our country. Because somebody had a difference of an opinion than you, you felt personally attacked instead of focusing on a bigger issue: **why do you listen to shitty music?**  

This pretty much sums up how I've always felt about Dave Matthews Band: I don't understand how or why they are so popular. They're a group who I categorize with John Mayer: I can understand that they are fantastic musicians (and they are), but their original songs are the worst part about them. "Crash" makes me cringe. "Your Body is a Wonderland" makes me vomit. But have you ever heard John play the blues? Have you ever heard Dave play country/folk tunes? Incredible.

**Listen to it if:** you got angry after the first paragraph and stopped reading.

**Memorable Tunes:** Bartender. I liked the biblically driven lyrics. I'm not religious (so it's really a good thing I'm only offending people based only on musical tastes, not faith), but the stories he wound into the song were interesting. I also loved the strings at the beginning.
