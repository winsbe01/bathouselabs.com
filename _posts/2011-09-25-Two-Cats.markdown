Red scarf, pink scarf, <br />
Tied in a bow. <br />
You're my pretty <br />
Don't you know?

Cool black cat <br />
With pupils small, <br />
Eyes of caramel, <br />
Ears stand tall.

Caramel cat <br />
With eyes of blue. <br />
Stripes run softly, <br />
Two by two.

No pale dishrag <br />
Tied in a knot. <br />
I'm your pretty, <br />
You forgot.
