A few years back, I was pretty into *Start Something.* It wasn't my favorite album, sure, but it was a challenging album, one I listened to fairly regularly. Remembering this, I was excited to visit one of their older albums, both to see how it matched up to *Start Something,* and to see if their appeal held up over time. What I found was less than I hoped for. While I still enjoyed their sound, this album seemed a lot more...forgettable, than their later releases. It just didn't seem as strong. To be fair, it was their first release, and their spark might not have come until later.

**Listen to it if:** you're a fan of alternative rock, or aren't a fan of white space.

**Memorable Tunes:** Still Laughing. As in, it somehow ended up on the list twice, so I remembered hearing it the second time it came on.
