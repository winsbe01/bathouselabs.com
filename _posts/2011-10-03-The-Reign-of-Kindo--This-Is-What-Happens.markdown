Have you ever had one of these experiences?

A few months ago, a good friend of mine texted me, telling me I *had* to listen to this band he just heard of. Not being one to turn down [recommendations][1] (least of all from him; he's a jazz saxophonist, fa cryin' out loud, so he knows his shit), I had him send me the albums and gave them a listen.

They were...good. Not earth-shattering (I *thought*), but very good.

Their best quality, I quickly realized, was their musicianship -- intricate rhythms, interesting chord progressions, the works. It wasn't as heavy as I was into at the moment (I'm still in the midst of a never-ending QotSA bender), so after a couple of listens, I put it on the shelf.

A little later, I got another text from this same friend telling me some exciting news: Kindo was playing a show and filming a DVD at the end of July! By this point he was head over heels for these guys (musically speaking), and I was digging their sound more and more on every listen.

Awesome!...but a few issues. I live and work in the Philadelphia area, and he was living in Connecticut at the time. The concert, of course, was in Buffalo, NY (aka God-help-us-we're-nearly-Canada, NY) on a Saturday night. We each worked 9-5 jobs with no vacation to spare, plus, we're each much too poor to fly.

After spending, er, half-a-second considering how ridiculous the whole idea was, we decided "what the hell." The band was great, the tickets were cheap, and we could turn it into a whirlwind road trip.

So at the end of August, the two of us made the 800+ mile round trip to Buffalo, plus my 450 mile round trip to get to Connecticut. In two-and-a-half days. Woof.

But was it worth it? **It was the greatest concert I have ever seen.** And I've seen some [pretty][rhcp] [cool][police] [concerts][muse].

This band is astoundingly talented. During their performance, there were up to *nine* musicians on stage, all playing in sync. Do you know how hard that is to do?! Meg White, half(!) of The White Stripes, can't keep in time with Jack. *On the album.* Oh, and remember that "intricate rhythms" bit? Kindo could play every song at tempo, unaltered, and *better* than on the record. It was incredible.

Since that show, I've listened to this album an unhealthy number of times, learning every lyric, anticipating every cadence. And the more I listen to it, the more I realize it is one of the most musically exciting and addictive albums I have heard in a very long time.

**Listen to it if:** you're looking for an album to grow with and deeply move you, or hearing that they're on Candy Rat makes you drool with anticipation.

**Memorable Tunes:** Thrill Of The Fall. This is the song they opened the show with, and is also the first track on the album. The energy in every note of this song is enough to knock you on your ass. It's also a heart-pounding introduction to something beautifully unexpected.
