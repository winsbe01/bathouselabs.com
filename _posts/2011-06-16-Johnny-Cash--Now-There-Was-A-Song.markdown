The Man in Black's got a voice like no other. If you've never heard Mr. Cash sing, I highly encourage giving him a listen, even if old tyme country isn't your thing. I've never heard a voice so deep and rich that wasn't used exclusively for bedroom entertainment (Barry White). This is the first studio album of his I listened to, and I was excited because it didn't have any of his hits. From the looks of it, he was covering traditional tunes on this album, a practice that isn't used as much today for some reason (except maybe in Hollywood, if that counts). He does them justice, and does them with typical Johnny Cash flair.

**Listen to it if:** you wanna know what country music is supposed to sound like.

**Memorable Tunes:** Transfusion Blues. My roommate sings this song all the time, although the lyrics of the version he sings substitutes "transfusion" for "cocaine." I don't know which is the original version. Either way, it's a catchy tune!
