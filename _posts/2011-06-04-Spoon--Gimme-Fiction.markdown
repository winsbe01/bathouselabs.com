I am absolutely in love with this album. These guys have all the catchiness of Radiohead without the *Kid A* craziness that made you feel like you were swimming through Syd Barrett's veins. It's got killer melodies and a strong groove behind it serving as the heartbeat of the music, driving it forward. I'm blown away. If you have any appreciation for music, you need this album.

**Listen to it if:** you're a fan of epiphanies, or your heart is beating.

**Memorable Tunes:** My Mathematical Mind. Yes, this is a nerdy title, and yes, I am a nerd, but I didn't remember this song for the title. This track is mostly driven by a simple piano melody on the lower keys, and a steady drumbeat. Nothing too fancy. But, add to that some small guitar fills, treble piano chords, and a great rock-singer's voice singing great lyrics, and you've got yourself an amazing song. Perfectly beautiful in its simplicity.
