*Sigh*

This album wasn't what I was hoping for at all, which is extremely depressing seeing as I bought this album. As in, I initiated a trade where I recieved these 15 songs in exchange for giving Amazon money. Yes, *real money.* Yes, I've heard of torrenting. Yes, I know how to use it. No, I'm not above sharing music between friends and family. No, it's not the same as torrenting. I'm not *riding my high horse,* I'm just buying music, you prick. Quit being an asshole!

(Note: the above argument, which went on between me and <insert basically any name here>, will most likely merit a post of its own someday)

Anyways, I originally bought a single on a whim (probably a sale or something) with two songs from this album on it, one featuring Jack White and one featuring Norah Jones. They were good tunes; not *amazing* (this should have given me a clue), but enjoyable.

See, my first experience with Dangermouse was on this record

But it's Dangermouse. This is how I've come to know him. While that collaboration was all hip-hop (and neither Norah Jones nor Jack White have any credibility as emcees), I was still expecting the musicality and interest to carry over into this album. For me, it did not. Maybe it just wasn't my type of music.

**Listen to it if:** you think anything Dangermouse touches turns to pure gold.

**Memorable Tunes:** Two Against One. This is the Jack White song from the single. I liked it when I first heard it, and I still think it was a standout track on the full album. I guess they made the right choice for the single.
