Soul! Just oozing with it! Nice backing riffs, and a voice that kills. Songs fit together nicely in a stellar record.

Listen to it if: you're anywhere with the windows open, feelin' groovy.

Memorable Tunes: Joy. The first song is acapella, so joy hits you with a sweet groove that sets the stage for the rest of the album.
