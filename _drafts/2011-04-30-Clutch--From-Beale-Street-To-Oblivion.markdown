I don't know, these guys didn't really stand out to me. They had some cool harmonica stuff, and some nice riffs. Nothing so exciting that would inspire me to actively seek out more, though.

Memorable Tunes: Electric Worry. I feel like I've heard this song before, though I don't know where. It's catchy, though, so that's good.
