**Loosely-related Rant**

The album from the previous review, Tony Lucca's Solo, I own was bought off Amazon MP3 (as are many of my albums). It's an "Amazon MP3 Exclusive" version, which usually means it features an extra B-Side or a digital booklet (seriously, does anyone read the digital booklets?). It's 11 tracks long. The last track is called "Thank You", in which Tony uses 24 seconds of your life to (you guessed it) thank you for buying the album, informing you of his website, Facebook, and Twitter info. Do I blame Tony for trying to get his name out? No. However, I pop over to Amazon to see if this is what's so "Exclusive" about this edition. No sign. So I Google the track listing for the album, to find out the one that Tony is selling on his website (and apparently everywhere else that isn't Amazon MP3) is fifteen tracks, none of which are the bullshit marketing shpeal. All this makes me beg the question: how f*cking "exclusive" is your version, Amazon? You should have called it a "Limited Edition", as in, "This edition has been limited to 10 tracks, for your inconvenience and rage." At least then you wouldn't be lying to me, and I could admire your wordplay.
