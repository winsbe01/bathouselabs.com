*How was she?*

Limp
like a wet towel
or a noodle out of the pot,
cooked, but drying.
Cold. Sticky.

Her breath smelled like ethanol,
her neck like chamomile,
her depth like loam.

I felt like a gardener:
down on my knees, tending
her wet earth, smoothing
her out, planting
seeds.

*Did it hurt?*

It felt like the moment after
being released
from a chokehold:

You gasp at the cool air,
drinking it down like water.
You can still feel the pinch
in your throat, but the sand
in your head sprinkles down
until your whole body tingles
and you melt in electric release.

She must have been brand-
new at it, fresh off the lot,
her plot unplanted, for she choked
like a wrestler, and I melted
a million milky snowmen.

*How old was she?*

Like my grandmother always says,
Age is just a state of mind, baby.
