Most people hear the name John Mayer and either cringe or say "Dude, have you ever listened to him high? It's some dope shit, right?" This album actually has a little for both demographics. Yes, it showcases some of his more popular tunes, but being an acoustic album he was forced to supplement it with some of his considerable guitar talent. I often forget that he is one of the better blues guitarists alive today but some of the riffs on the album are a stark reminder. Overall it's exactly what you would expect from an acoustic pop album with a little extra for those who care to listen for it.

Listen to it if: You are a fan of John Mayer or if you're heard some of his trio and blues work and are curious what he can really put together.

Memorable Tunes: Belief. It's always been a good song in my opinion but the minimalist sound on the acoustic along with the great acoustic solo in the middle really give it a new feel. Good Love Is On The Way.  This one was originally written with his trio so it's a very good song musically to begin with and I really dig how the main riff sounds on the acoustic.
