It's fully June
in sweltering Georgia
and everything is heavy.

Daisy petals droop,
defeated. Water slinks
away into the ground.

Even the crane flies
hover languidly, nibbling the crust
at the corner of a man's lips.

A spider hangs
from an eyelid, lowering
evenly as an elevator.

Shoelaces dangle softly
like spaghetti. Robins eye them
like worms from their nests.

A deer rambles over
damp leaves, and leans to lap
the blood from her hoof.

This ripe fruit, held up
by a twist of leather, rots
beneath the stifling blanket

of a southern summer.
The deer meanders off
into the trees, perhaps to nap.
