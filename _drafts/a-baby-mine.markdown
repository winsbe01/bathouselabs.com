a baby, mine, cries out from down the hall
emerging from the softest arms of sleep
alone, afraid, his daddy a shrill call
away. his bear curled limp by naked fee,

i bring it to his face for him to kiss
and hold, and drift back into a soft snooze.
this boy, softly beautiful breathing, his
round eyes shut, calm now, body limp and loose.

how odd to be scared of this gently night
when true ghosts and demons lay quiet, wait-
ing for the tide of understanding light
to wash over him, to choke this fresh bait.

how cruel the world that lies beyond his crib
the worst, me, protector, who let him live.
