Do I soothe you?

After endless days stuffed in
stiff starched shirts,
long meetings and hard handshakes,
infiltrations, penetrations,
wiretaps, covert ops,
seeking out and killing Red
to save the White and Blue,
what do I do for you?

Me, an ivory piece of lace,
two cups to hold you,
two straps to squeeze
and a clasp to keep you in one piece,
buried in your closet like a dead man.

When the shades are drawn,
the lights dim, the streets a soft whisper,
you exhume me, hold me up
and slip me over your bare arms.
How do I feel?

When you reach around to buckle me,
push me up on your hard chest,
adjust the strap on your shoulder,
how do I make you feel?

Your eyes in the mirror are heavy.
Is it shame?  Fatigue?
Or do you dread loosening the straps,
undoing the clasp, slipping me off, and
crawling naked into bed knowing
I will never be able to satisfy?

Oh, the secrets we keep.
