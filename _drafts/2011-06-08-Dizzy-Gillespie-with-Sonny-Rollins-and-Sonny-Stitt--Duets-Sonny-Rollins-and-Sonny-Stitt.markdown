This album has a nice sound, but doesn't stand out to me as a must-have album for jazz fans. I'm not saying it was bad -- it was actually quite pleasant. However, as is too often the case with these multi-mega-musician type albums, expectations run higher than the album delivers.

Listen to it if: you're absolutely a die-hard fan, or happen to have it around.

Memorable tunes: Con Alma [Alternate Take]. I really like the Latin feel of the piece. Usually I'm not the biggest fan of Latin Jazz, but this tune stuck with me.
