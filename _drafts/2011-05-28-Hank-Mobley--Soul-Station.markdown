I needed this album right now. Nothing works better to ease stress like a good jazz album. And this definitely fits the bill. From the first song, I could just feel the relief and relaxation wash over me in a sweet saxophone line, and never looked back.

Listen to it if: stress has eroded your stomach lining to the point where you consider yourself having an open digestive system.

Memorable Tunes: Remember. The first song. When I heard it, I knew everything was gonna be alright.
