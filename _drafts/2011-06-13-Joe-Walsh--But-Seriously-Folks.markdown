Joe Walsh -- But Seriously, Folks
[ Posted Mon, 13 Jun 2011 10:00:06 ]

Joe Walsh, of The Eagles fame, puts out a solid (albeit short) classic rock album here. It features his radio hit "Life's Been Good," as well as a bunch of other good songs. While I'm not always in the mood for classic rock, this album sat well, and it's shorter length allowed me to enjoy the whole thing, instead of wanting to tear out my ears after track 9 (which is a usual response).

Listen to it if: you like the Eagles, or other bands in a similar vein.

Memorable Tunes: Second Hand Store. I enjoyed the slight variations from the traditional rock groove.
