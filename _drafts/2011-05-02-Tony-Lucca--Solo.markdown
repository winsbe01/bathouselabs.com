Tony Lucca -- Solo
[ Posted Mon, 02 May 2011 19:19:15 ]

Tony Lucca's got a nice singer/songwriter folk thing going on here, which I'm totally digging. I love his voice; it's got a Bob Dylan type quality, except it's much cleaner (plus, ya know, he doesn't slur, nor does it sound like his throat is made of nails). The album has many relaxing tunes, mostly just guitar (it is a folk album, after all), but some piano as well, which suits it nicely.

Listen to it if: you would like some good folk music that isn't somehow tied to the Vietnam War.

Memorable Tunes: New York City. A great start to the album, I love his pining voice in the chorus.
