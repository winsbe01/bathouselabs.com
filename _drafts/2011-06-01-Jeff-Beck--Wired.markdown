Jeff Beck -- Wired
[ Posted Wed, 01 Jun 2011 10:00:06 ]

I've never really listened to Jeff Beck before, so let me tell you: he's weird. Like, weirder than I expected. His music on this album is all instrumental, but it's got lots of elements of funk, as well as tons of prog-rock/improv elements. I enjoyed listening to it, if only for the surprise that Jeff Beck didn't play what I thought he was going to play.

Listen to it if: you like Dream Theater. Or hate communism.

Memorable Tunes: Head For Backstage Pass. During a pause in this tune, I heard the bass just go apeshit, and before this point, I had only really heard the guitar and drums. The bassist is nasty and funky as hell, so it's worth a listen to just for that.
