Bad Meets Evil -- Hell: The Sequel

To fully understand the importance of this album, you must know the back story. One of the last tracks (and one of the strongest, IMHO) on Eminem's first studio album The Slim Shady LP is a number called Bad Meets Evil, featuring Royce Da 5'9", another talented, hard-hitting MC. The two of them together were absolute gold. After a fallout in their relationship, as well as Eminem's trip through addiction and rehab, they are back together again for a full album.

While this is definitely a killer album, it doesn't have quite the punch of their original partnership. This unfortunate reality is also an understanding one: not only has the rap game as a whole changed since 1999, both MCs have had their fair share of life experiences that have changed them on a personal level. However, it's still a fantastic matchup, and an album long-awaited by many, myself included.

Listen to it if: you've never heard of Royce Da 5'9", or you think Young Money has all the freshest hip-hop these days.

Memorable Tunes: A Kiss. As if you couldn't figure it out by this point in the album, both Slim and Royce reaffirm their position as two of the baddest emcees alive, both individually and as a pair.
