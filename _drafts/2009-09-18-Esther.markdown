you do not do, you do not do
anymore, Sylvia,
your thumb stump a lid stamp,
redcoats feeding flowers
(chrysanthemums, every one)

a Lady of the Earth,
box in a green field,
fair skin and farewell
to that jar, that bell
who ate up all your air

and pushed you head-first
into an oven. Is this
how you depart? singed
hair and hospital wards,
not enough for your thick words.

to die a third time, like a Jew,
are there marks of the boot-heel?
was it a poem, like everything else,
or were we not enough for you?
Oh Sylvia, *Ach du.*
