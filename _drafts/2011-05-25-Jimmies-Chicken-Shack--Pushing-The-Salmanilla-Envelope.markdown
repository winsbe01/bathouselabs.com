Jimmie's Chicken Shack -- Pushing The Salmanilla Envelope
[ Posted Wed, 25 May 2011 00:18:11 ]

These guys are not at ALL who I thought they were going to be. When I hear "Jimmie's Chicken Shack", I don't think of a hard-rocking group who's sound approaches that of the Chili Peppers. I think of that shitty band from high school who seemed to play at every local concert you went to even though they were a mediocre-at-best punky band. If you had the same thought, not only are you wrong, you're gonna be so excited about how wrong you are.

Listen to it if: you're looking for some fun rock a la Red Hot Chili Peppers from someone other than Anthony Kiedis.

Memorable Tunes: Hole. Not only is the timing a more 6/8 feel, which I love, it shows off how good they each are at their instruments, and how good they are at combining them into an extremely catchy song.
