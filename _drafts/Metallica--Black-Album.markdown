Metallica -- Black Album

Once upon a yesteryear, I considered myself a metal-head. I was also naive and stupid, but that's besides the point. I listened to Slipknot, Mudvayne, and...umm, Limp Bizkit? I really don't know if these three bands put me in the metal-head realm, but I sure hoped so! Anyways, during this foray into crunching guitars, quadruple-bass drums, and throat-splitting screaming, I somehow never listened to this album, which is supposedly one of the best metal albums ever (according to some). How silly of me.

Well, I've listened to it now, and the radio sure seemed to think it was a stellar album. At least half the tracks I've heard elsewhere, on the radio or in movies, which is very impressive. Even the songs that didn't make their way out into the airwaves are solid tunes. I am no longer a metal-head, but I can respect and agree with the praise this album has received.

Listen to it if: you think you're a hardcore metal-head because you listen to Every Time I Die or Static X. Don't be naive like I was.

Memorable Tunes: Holier Than Thou. This was the first one I came across that I haven't heard elsewhere. Pretty solid tune. Sounds a lot like the rest of them.
