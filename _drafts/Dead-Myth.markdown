Put the myth to bed,
it's never brought us good.
Jesus Christ is dead

to me. Father always said,
*Trust in God and your food
will be plentiful, your bed*

*always warm.* I took bread
for body, drank wine for blood.
Now Father is dead.

But his words still hang in my head
by the wrists. Mud
in my eyes and a cold bed,

God gave me nothing. I was bred
for Faith, but I am not a bud
of Eden. I'm dead

branches on a dying tree. I read
between the lines, plugged the flood,
and put the myth to bed.
Jesus Christ is dead.
