Jefferson Airplane -- Surrealistic Pillow

This is one of those groups that I've heard of a million times and always go "Oh yeah, them, I know them. Wait, who are they?" Well, now I can tell you...sorta. At points in the album, it sounded like Bob Dylan was singing. At other points, The Beatles. Even Janis Joplin made an appearance. I do love all these musicians (except maybe Janis -- I can only handle so much), but I wasn't expecting them to appear being channeled through Jefferson Airplane. These shifts in artist sound-alikes made the album sound disjointed to me, but the songs themselves were enjoyable.

Listen to it if: you miss 1968.

Memorable Tunes: Somebody To Love. This is when it clicked who these guys were. I've heard and enjoyed this song before, but didn't make the connection. There were a few more on this album that gave me this "aha!" moment as well.
