Curren$y -- Pilot Talk II
[ Posted Mon, 02 May 2011 14:49:04 ]

Normally, the next couple sentences would be spent mocking Curren$y's, um, spelling. I tend to lean in favor of using a language's alphabet when spelling things in that language, but Curren$y has the talent to back it up (Ke$ha, take note). Pilot Talk II (which, as you might guess, is the sequel to Pilot Talk) is pretty dope. His rap isn't an angry, in-your-face, give-me-fellatio kind of rap, but a very chill sound that you can bob your head to without feeling like you're being yelled at. I personally see this as a great album to have on as filler music, not something that takes over a conversation or an activity, but surrounds it in nice music. And the occasional curse word.

Listen to it if: you're in the zone. Driving, writing, whittling a shiv from a toothbrush. You name it.

Memorable Tunes: Flight Briefing. This was the only song on the record that made me tense, but not because I was being threatened. The chorus is filled with a (supposed) flight attendant explaining the exit procedure on an aircraft in case of emergency. This irked me because I really don't like flying, and about 80% of that is because these same flight attendants insist on hitting my elbow when passing with the drink cart, even when I'm not sitting on the aisle. Jerks.
