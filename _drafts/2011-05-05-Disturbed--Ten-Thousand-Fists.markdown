Disturbed -- Ten Thousand Fists
[ Posted Thu, 05 May 2011 15:40:16 ]

I'm not really a Disturbed kind-of guy. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm certainly disturbed, but for some reason, this band (who is also quite disturbed) doesn't really do it for me. I remember the first time I listened to The Sickness. I was a wee tot (okay, maybe 12 or so), and I thought, This album ROCKS! It's all yelling and barking and loud guitars, whoop whoop! Clearly I've lost that innocent love for the yelling (or maybe I'm a cat person now), but this album, while retaining many of the qualities that I loved about their past work, I have no problem passing on.

Listen to it if: you are a throat-lozenge distributor looking for potential future clients.

Memorable Tunes: Ten Thousand Fists. Yeah, it's the first one, and I'm pretty sure it was on the radio, but after it ended, I had my Disturbed fill and was ready to move on.
