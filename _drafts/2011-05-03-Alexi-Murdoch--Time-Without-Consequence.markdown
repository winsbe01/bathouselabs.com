Alexi Murdoch -- Time Without Consequence
[ Posted Tue, 03 May 2011 12:16:32 ]

One word very prominently came to mind when I heard this album: repetition. Yes, choruses are good, and the familiar lines allows people to sing along. Yes, specific repeated progressions are good, they keep the song flowing and ensures that your half-wit bass player (or did I say the same thing twice?) doesn't lose track of where he is in the song. However, when I begin thinking to myself, "Gee, I feel like I've heard him say these lines about twenty times now," it's time to write some more lyrics and lines. They were original once upon a time, but their spark and profound impact wore off around the third time I heard them.

Listen to it if: you're dangling a pocket watch in front of someone's eyes. Well, don't listen, but definitely have it playing.

Memorable Tunes: Home. After hearing a bunch of repeated phrases, I decided to really start taking in what he was saying. Cause, ya know, it could be something amazingly deep and I'm an idiot for missing it. Or perhaps a poorly delivered joke. I'm hoping it's the second, because in this tune, part of Alexi's inspired lyrics are the words of a popular children's rhyme, "Row, row, row your boat." I wish I were joking.
