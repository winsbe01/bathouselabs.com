Gorillaz -- Plastic Beach

If I may make a suggestion, don't sit down with this album expecting to do nothing but listen to it. You will go insane. I was doing other things while I listened, and I'm still feeling like my mind was just invaded. There is a good chance that Plastic Beach is stuffed full of subliminal messages. That being said, it's also stuffed full of some interesting featured artists. The album opened with Snoop Dogg on the track, which surprised me. He's much more into gangsta stuff, where as Gorillaz is toe-ing the line between hypnotism and hip-hop. Overall an interesting listen, though. Provided you're otherwise occupied.

Listen to it if: you're in a non-vulnerable state. Much like there are tapes to put on while you sleep to convince you to quit smoking, this album will also change your behavior in the real-world if you listen to it while dreaming. If you value the current chemical makeup of your brain, then for the love of god, get a cup of coffee first.

Memorable Tunes: White Flag. The beat was enticing, and I turned up the volume to hear more of it. When I did, I noticed lots of subtle hints and instruments that come together to produce a strong, interesting sound. Musicians who can pull that off will never cease to impress me.
