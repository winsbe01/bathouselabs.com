Citizen Cope -- The Rainwater LP
[ Posted Fri, 29 Apr 2011 13:52:11 ]

Rainwater is a chill album, just like Clarence Greenwood. It sounds remarkably similar too. Citizen Cope is much like a Twinkie in that it will always taste the same no matter what century you eat it in. He's unlike a Twinkie in that he probably won't survive a nuclear holocaust. The music is dependable, almost sickeningly so. He's mastered his sound (and don't get me wrong -- it's a good sound), but his lack of variation does get stale after awhile.

Listen to it if: you loved Clarence Greenwood, and want 10 more songs that sound just like it.

Memorable Tunes: Jericho. This one is a bit different, not as laid back or melodic. I actually didn't care for it all that much. Maybe he should stick to the whole "one sound" thing...
