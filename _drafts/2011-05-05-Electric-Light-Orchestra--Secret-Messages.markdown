I liked this album a lot more than I thought I was going to. ELO never really got me jazzed up, and while they're still not gonna be on top of my to-listen list, this album was pretty slick. I heard lots of sounds that were reminiscent of the Beatles, and it's hard to argue with a band who takes strong inspiration from the Fab Four. The guitar work throughout was sick too, especially the tone.

Listen to it if: you like the Beatles, but also enjoy some more modern, synth-sounding instruments.

Memorable Tunes: After All. Yeah, it's the odd one out on the record because it's short, it's orchestral, and there's no lyrics. But I really enjoyed the piece, as it reminded me of the interesting orchestral pieces Muse does.
