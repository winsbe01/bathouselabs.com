Dead Coyote -- Where The Water Rises
[ Posted Wed, 04 May 2011 13:09:56 ]

From the sound of this album, Dead Coyote doesn't have much money to spend on big-name studio time. Either that or their producer is evil. The guitars have a gritty, Black Keys-y sound to them, rough like they're mimic-ing the sounds before sound booths, good microphones, and Pro Tools. I can dig that. However, the vocals. Sweet Jesus, the vocals. If I had to guess, I would say the band piled into one of their bathrooms, dropped a mic in the sink, and went for it. But here's the thing -- maybe that's not the end of the world, because when you listen to them, they're not singing. They're doing a combination of yelling and whining. It's not like this adds anything to the music style (like yelling might add to metal or whining to Bieber songs). It sounds like they said "Well, none of us can sing at all, but maybe if we all try and sing it together, it'll work." Well, sorry guys, it didn't.

Listen to it if: you're recording an album by yourself with cheap equipment and think you're gonna make a hit record. It will not sound any better than this, I promise you.

Memorable Tunes: Introduction. There were no lyrics, so I was still blissfully ignorant of the pain I would endure during the following 17 tracks.
