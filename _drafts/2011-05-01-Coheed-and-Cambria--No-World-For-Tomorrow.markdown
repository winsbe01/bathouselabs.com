Coheed and Cambria -- No World For Tomorrow

This is a pretty hard rockin' album. I gotta admit, the singer's voice took me by surprise when I first heard it, but I ended up liking it rather quickly. I've probably been avoiding this band because of their popularity among those of the emo persuasion (when I really should have been embracing them because of their sick name), but when it comes down to it, they play some hard-hitting tunes. Though I can totally see the emo connection.

Listen to it if: you're looking for some crunchy rock and/or are wearing black eyeliner.

Memorable Tunes: The End Complete V: On the Brink. This is the fifth of a five-part song to, uh, complete the album. I remember it because at one point, it started screaming at me, and I swear I could hear the SS marching in Hell on the background track.
