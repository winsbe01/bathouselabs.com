Common -- Be
[ Posted Sun, 08 May 2011 19:12:00 ]

This is a nice album from a Chicago-based (I believe) rapper, Common. It's a pretty tight album, and the beats and rhymes are up there with some of the best. One song features him and Kanye live on Chappelle's Show (oh how I miss that program) where Common holds his own, further proving that he is a force to be reckoned with.

Listen to it if: you're itching for some quality hip-hop from someone you may not have heard of.

Memorable Tunes: The Corner. It's just a fun song, and I got really into the rhythm and the chorus.
