John Lennon -- Acoustic
[ Posted Wed, 15 Jun 2011 10:00:06 ]

I'm a huge Beatles fan. Huge. Like, enormously huge. However, I have honestly never listened to a John Lennon solo album. Let the hate mail flow.

I know "Imagine" is a great song, but I loved John with the Beatles. I didn't want to lose any respect for him by hearing his solo stuff because I've felt a bit of that for McCartney. I haven't listened to a whole lot of Paul's solo stuff, but I have heard Wings, and I'm not really a fan. The two of them as a team were dyn-o-mite, and I wanted to always remember them as such.

I do really like acoustic guitar, though, and I dig John's politically-charged lyrics, so this album was enjoyable. As I expected, Yoko made her way into a track, but thankfully for only a brief time. I'm looking forward to finding another Lennon album to indulge in, and would love recommendations.

Listen to it if: you've got strong anti-government pro-love feelings.

Memorable Tunes: Working Class Hero. I love this song. I haven't heard it many times before, but I think I like it even more acoustic.
