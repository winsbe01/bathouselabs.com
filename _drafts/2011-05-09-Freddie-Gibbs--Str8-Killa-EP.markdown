Freddie Gibbs -- Str8 Killa EP
[ Posted Mon, 09 May 2011 19:50:35 ]

This is a nice (and long, at 8 tracks) EP from an up-and-coming MC. Freddie's flow is smooth, and he's got some dope beats to back him up. I'm gonna say, my mind isn't completely blown away by him -- not yet, that is. This is his first EP on a label, and I don't think we've heard the last of this talented MC. (According to Wikipedia, he released two mixtapes free to the internet -- something I'm gonna check out, and recommend that you do too!)

Listen to it if: you thought all Hoosiers were crazy white people, or you didn't understand that last statement.

Memorable Tunes: Live By The Game. A popular theme for hip hop songs, I'm finding, is highlighting how dangerous the game is ("the game", for the uninitiated, being the hip-hop scene/world). The first track that comes to mind is "My Life" by Game (the artist), a recent hit featuring Weezy. While this isn't exclusively about hip-hop culture, it does talk a lot about the dangers of it. A lot of other songs in this vein reference Pac and Biggie, the unintentional martyrs of hip-hop, wondering why people feud and if it's even worth it. Freddie's track can stand among these other great tunes, and reaffirms his commitment to his craft and style, regardless of how dangerous it may be.
