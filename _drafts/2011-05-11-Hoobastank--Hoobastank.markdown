Hoobastank -- Hoobastank

At this point, some of you may be wondering, "Why do you do this to yourself? Hoobastank? Really?" And to that, dear friends, I answer, "I don't know! Dear God, why?!"

All non-joking aside, this album was pretty...meh. My ears are bleeding a little bit, but not too bad. I still seem to be alive, but everything suddenly seems...ugly, and gray. My fever's low-grade, and I feel sore, like my kidneys have suddenly given up, let themselves go, started having ice cream for dinner and vodka for breakfast. It kind of feels like what happened when I put the Do Not Remove label on my mattress along with a fork and a voodoo doll I made of myself in the microwave, then stood in front of it while it shat sparks and radiation as my counter melted into plasma. I also felt this way the first time I heard Gaga's "Just Dance."

Listen to it if: Nickelback just doesn't hurt enough anymore.

Memorable Tunes: Give It Back. For one, it's the last song, so I was freed at it completion. Also, they start talking about food or something after the music stopped. It was surreal and uncomfortable, and that's really not the way to end an already painful album.
