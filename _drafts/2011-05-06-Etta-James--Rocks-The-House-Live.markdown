This girl's got a fire burnin' in her soul. If you hear her speak, she sounds like a sweet, quiet, innocent young girl. When you hear her sing, you'll be amazed at what power erupts from her voice. This Star Time recording features Etta tearing it up on the blues, and is well worth a listen to.

Listen to it if: you've got any soul whatsoever.

Memorable Tunes: Something's Got A Hold On Me. Killer start to the show, and it just keeps getting better from there.
