Hollywood Undead -- Swan Songs
[ Posted Fri, 10 Jun 2011 10:00:06 ]

Holy crap, now this is a very different type of music. They are described as a rap rock band, but if there exists a more generic way of describing them, I haven't heard it. If I had to convey to you who Hollywood Undead is, it would be much more graphic and complicated. Shall we?

Picture Slipknot for me. Got it? Crazy masks, hardcore metal music, the works.

Next, picture Vanilla Ice. Big ego rapper, lame lyrics.

Now Eminem. Another big ego rapper, but with much better lyrics, smooth flow, incredible amounts of unbridled anger.

If Eminem and Vanilla Ice made disgusting, self-deprecating love while each of them were tripping on a cocktail of legal and illegal substances, and their deformed, sympathy-worthy lovechild were to do the nasty with Slipknot (as a whole, somehow, not each one individually), and their baby was subsequently dropped on it's poor little head, now you have a more adequate picture of who Hollywood Undead really is.

It's rap'sorta. The lyrics and flow are hit or miss, most often a terrible miss. It's metal too...sorta. It's not driving, it's more like a metal/hip-hop hybrid. Oh, and they totally wear masks, probably to cover the unfortunate physical features the above scenario would have led to. Either that or they don't want to be recognized in public.

Listen to it if: you are looking for something that makes your brain go "Whaaaaa...??"

Memorable Tunes: Everywhere I Go. The lyrics in this song are laughably lame and terrible. I also made the fortunate mistake of looking up a music video, and what I found was absolutely unbelievable. However, I think the song, in all it's terrible glory, is actually kinda catchy. Also, I can't believe I'm saying that.
