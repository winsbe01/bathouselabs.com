My Chemical Romance -- Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge

I really don't have anything interesting to say. This album was very emotional, with slight reservation on the "tional" part. But, as far as these types of bands and albums go, it really wasn't that bad. I know, you were hoping I'd make fun of their sound, or their song names, or the fact that the album cover is a picture of a guy and a girl, presumably on their wedding day, covered in blood spatter, drawn in an anime paper-cutout kind of way, but I'm not. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. I'll never listen to it again, but I won't have nightmares for years about it either.

Listen to it if: you're heartbroken and you wanna whine about it in music.

Memorable Tunes: I'm Not Okay (I Promise). I think this is actually a cry for help. Like, someone should go check on this guy, he sounds like he's in a really bad place.
