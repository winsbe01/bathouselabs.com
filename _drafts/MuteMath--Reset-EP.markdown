MuteMath -- Reset EP

I'm really not sure how I feel about MuteMath. Something about their music attracts me to them, while another part really turns me off. Their like sirens. Not like police sirens, like, singin', sexy, shit-I-crashed-my-boat sirens. I don't know. Listen to them for yourself, and let me know if you have any insight.

Listen to it if: you read the above paragraph and are kind enough to listen to me.

Memorable Tunes: Reset. Instrumental, but very very good.
