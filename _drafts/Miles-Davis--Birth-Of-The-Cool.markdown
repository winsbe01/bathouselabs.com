Miles Davis - Birth Of The Cool

Miles Davis and jazz are almost synonymous, interchangable terms. He's got 
a presence in jazz music held by only a few other steller artists, and has the 
privaledge of being a household name even outside of the jazz world. This album is
one of his more famous, and it shows: it's wonderful. The music on here is outstanding,
interesting, and approachable. I would recommend this album to anyone.

Listen to it if: jazz has a hold on you, or you just don't realize it yet.

Memorable tunes: Darn That Dream. Someone actually sings on this track, something I 
wasn't expecting as I hadn't heard it before on a Miles Davis record. It was a 
different experience, and I'm not sure if I liked it or didn't, I was too surprised.
