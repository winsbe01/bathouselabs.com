Jakob Dylan -- Seeing Things

This is a nice, smooth album, with Jakob doing mostly acoustic guitar work and singing. He's got a nice voice; it's a bit gravelly, but at the same time soft, like a blanket covered in sand, or some better metaphor perhaps. I enjoyed his tunes, but I don't know if I'd listen to them all the time. A nice escape from electric craziness, though.

Listen to it if: your ears are still bleeding after a metal concert, and you need something that won't hurt.

Memorable Tunes: Evil Is Alive and Well. Not only is it a cool name, it's a very nice tune as well. Interesting, soft, yet catchy.
