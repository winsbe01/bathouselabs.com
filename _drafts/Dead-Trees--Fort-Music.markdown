The Dead Trees -- Fort Music

This short album has a very brit-indie-rock feel, both by the arrangement of the pieces and the sound of the singer's voice. I liked it, but it didn't have the same punch as, say, Arctic Monkeys, who I'd place in the same category. The Dead Trees have a more laid back sound, it seems, so it didn't quite grab me as vigorously.

Listen to it if: you hum "God Save The Queen" subconsciously. Or "Old Yellow Bricks".

Memorable Tunes: Shelter. There's an instrument they use during the verses, and I can't tell if it's a crank (like those found on drums in 20's era music) or that duck-sounding instrument uses extensively in CAKE songs.
