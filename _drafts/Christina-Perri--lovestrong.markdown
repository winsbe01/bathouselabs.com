Christina Perri - lovestrong

I'm in love with this girl and this album. The passion she drips from each lyric, each
piano run and chorus is just completely intoxicating and unforgettable. I bought a live
EP of her live in the studio on a whim and was blown away, so I had to get this album 
(and even paid more than I usually do for music to get it). Every one of her songs has got a
soul that's addicting. Out of the 12 songs on the album, I think there's only one or two that
were mediocre. This is definitely an album to put on repeat.

Listen to it if: you've got a taste for strong voices and piano melodies.

Memorable Tunes: Tragedy. It's a killer end to the album, and her emotion almost brought me
to tears. An artist's goal should be to move people, and evicting a physical response is
often the hardest to do. Christina Perri did it for me in this song, and I'm misty just
thinking about it.
