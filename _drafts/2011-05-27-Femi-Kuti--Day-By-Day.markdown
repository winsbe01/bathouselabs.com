Femi Kuti -- Day By Day
[ Posted Fri, 27 May 2011 10:00:06 ]

Here's a bit of world music for everyone. Femi's music is very percussive; you can hear influences of Latin music, African music, and American Jazz. He's got a soulful voice, but not in the traditional sense. He sings his music with passion, so while his voice may not be a beautiful songbird out your window, he loves it, and to me that's more important than anything.

Listen to it if: you are looking for a bit of a change-up from today's more popular forms.

Memorable Tunes: Day By Day. I really loved the lyrics, they struck a chord.
