Joe Satriani -- Surfing With The Alien
[ Posted Sun, 12 Jun 2011 10:00:06 ]

This album is supposedly a groundbreaking foray into...something, I can't remember. Maybe cool guitar sounds, because Satriani does some cool things with his guitar. No lyrics, though. I knew this going into the album, and figured it wouldn't be a problem, but I think his style would benefit from a good lyric-writer and a singer. Luckily, he's now in Chickenfoot, so hopefully he's found a nice counter-balance to his style.

Listen to it if: you want all juicy guitar, and no BS.

Memorable Tunes: Satch Boogie. This tune grooves right along, and his drummer gets some sick fills in.
