once a mother and always
a woman holds a cool pot
beneath a spewing spout

*see-ayche-are-why-ess-ayy-en*
a child whispers, dragging her crayon
across a fragile leaf

brings the bowl to the stove
lets the liquid slosh

*tee-ayche-ee* and the crayon breaks,
the paper tears along a corner

*honey, use the blue one.
which was grandma's favorite?*

the puddle slides and spreads,
the flower hangs petal-less

the water heats, steams,
but can't boil
