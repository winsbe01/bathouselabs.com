The first one was an accident. Kind of.
A man felt his rights being stepped
on and stepped
up.
Bam. Offisser just doing his job.
It’s not genocide if no one says “go”.

A few hundred later, a kid gets up-
set, mother’s being pushed around,
gets a butt to the
throat.
He chokes, coughs, passes out, mother
can’t carry him, has to let go.

Number three thousand six hundred thirty.
Process is still rough, but to make an omelet 
you need to crack some
skulls.
Bludgeon to the head, blood
stain on cobblestone. “Go.”

Two hundred thousand. Two hundred. Two.
Pierced lung, shotgun, thirty year old down
screaming, sixteen reloads at his
post.
Families cry, prayers and stars, children
just stare and wonder, where did Abba go?

One million. A cool mill. Seven digits, a lucky
death. Woman, pregnant, stabbed in the gut.
Her baby would wail, if it
could.
If blood were holy you might call her God.
She grips the carcass as her baby goes.

Three million or four, who knows? They
fall in droves now, who can count who
files in, showers, then
reeks?
There are piles upon piles of women
and children. The weak, the first to go.

Freedom comes near six million, but still
a man’s stomach eats itself. It’s hard to
subsist on moldy bread and
rats.
What a pity to persist just to drop
at friendly feet who sing “time to go.”

Six million, four hundred fifteen.
A man, forty three, his family killed,
his spirit shot, he
survives.
But does he? And who is he? His home is
burned, his feet ache. Where can he go?

“A boy at school this morning called me nigger,”
my son dictated in a simple way.
For this, my mother’s heart has no vigor

to tell my only child, who’s no bigger
than three foot tall, no older than a day
and six years, just what is a nigger.

His father, startled, straightened like a pillar
and dropped his fork, unsure of what to say.
His usual self-confidence and vigor

was shot down. My son had pulled the trigger,
didn’t know it, had to watch Dad decay
and leave the room, head in his hands. Nigger

cloaks our lunch table, hovers low, a figure
of darkness. It sucks the air, breathes a spray
so vile I choke. The world’s taste now so vigor-

ous it cuts the tongue. I thought skin was thicker,
but I avert my eyes as blood displays,
and pray for the day we’ll never hear it: nigger.
The bastard word still holds strong its vigor.

Yesterday,
I was fifteen minutes late
to trim your hedges.
My daughter had pneumonia,
the line at the free clinic was around the block
and my wife left for work before dawn.

I asked for sympathy,
plead for forgiveness.
You wouldn’t pay for my first hour.
You said next time, you’d fire me.
*Gracias,* Master. *Gracias.*

Today,
I was right on time
but you still threw a fit, and shoved
pool-cleaning tools into my hands.
*Senora,* I say, *it’s raining. Aren’t there chores
in the house you need done?*

You frown, spit in my face,
and call me a lazy mexican.
You say I’m good-for-nothing,
sitting on my A-S-S, and you
are gonna call the I-N-S.

So Tomorrow,
I’ll be there early with a shovel
to smash the white-faced grins
off every gnome in your garden
until your perfect lawn
is fertilized with porcelain.

I might put the spic in spic-and-span,
but I’m as dry as your voice.
Muchos Gracias for the bullshit,
but I can get a job anywhere
'cause who needs a green card 
when you have an S-S-N.
