Back Door Slam -- Roll Away
---------------------------

Bluesy, country-inspired rock. Sounds like it has roots in the south, but guitar tone and riffs from heavier rock, perhaps even metal. Voice reminds me slightly of Kings of Leon, but don't quote me on that because I haven't listened to them either. Well put-together album.

**Listen to it if:** you wanna hear some country tunes but are embarrassed by cowboy hats.

**Memorable Tunes:** *Come Home.* Non-traditional rhythm, sweet bass riff.
