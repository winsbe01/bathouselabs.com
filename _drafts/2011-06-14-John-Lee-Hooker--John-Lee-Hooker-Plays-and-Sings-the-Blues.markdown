John Lee Hooker -- John Lee Hooker Plays and Sings the Blues
[ Posted Tue, 14 Jun 2011 10:00:06 ]

Somehow, in all the jazz and blues listening I've done over the years, I've still not intentionally listened to a John Lee Hooker album. This seems like a crime against American Music in general, so I thought it was about time. I really enjoyed this album -- he's got a perfect voice for the art. The guitar was also fantastic. I like how blues guitar (not SRV electric blues, but traditional acoustic blues) is intricate yet very subtle and subdued. Hooker is a master at this, and it comes through on this record.

Listen to it if: you're a true American.

Memorable Tunes: Baby Please Don't Go. I've heard other versions of this song, and I really enjoy it. Hooker does a great rendition of it.
