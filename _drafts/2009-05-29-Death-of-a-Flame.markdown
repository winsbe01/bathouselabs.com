When life begins, a single spark
Jumps out to kiss a piece of bark
And steadily, there comes a light
That splits the shadows from the dark.

The timbers wince at cinders' flight;
A new disruption of the night.

And as it's stretched beyond its means,
The monster drives into the dreams
Of Man.  This creature must be saved
Despite the death of luscious greens.

And with this thought, the crackling craved
The care of Human Man enslaved.

But though he once stood strong and bold,
Even the devil's child gets old
And as the ash o'ertakes the brush,
The passionate heat succumbs to cold.

The fire's mortal life is such
Like that which only God can touch.
