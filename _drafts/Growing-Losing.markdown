We spent nights playing Yahtzee,
in leather chairs that spin,
pale white and wrinkled like your skin.
Pop rolls the dice,
you ask him what he needs:
*A doctor, a lawyer, and an Indian Chief.*

In Orlando, our first vacation with you,
you gave me a watch like yours:
Mickey Mouse on a gold face with a brown leather band.
It sang, and Mickey swung his arms
at the push of a button.
We stood on the patio, looking out at the sand,
you with your cigarette, me with my watch
to match Grandmom's.

Your house always meant presents.
Once, a plush mouse for my sister,
a furry bear for me.
Perfect, until
my sister changed her mind
(she was 8 and an expert at that).
I wouldn't swap on principle,
so you went digging for more gifts,
came out of your bedroom
with a doll you'd had as a child.

It stopped our fighting, but not because
we were even. It was a doll that sat proudly
on your bed for years. I could only imagine
the emptiness you felt when my sister
gobbled it up in her arms.

Where's the doll now?
At the bottom of a closet, crushed
beneath boxes of newer, shinier toys?
Tag-saled off
to a passing young girl, who fell in love
with it the way you had?

The Mickey watch lies on my desk
gathering dust, out of batteries.
I pick it up occasionally,
and can still smell the sunscreen,
see specks of sand in its crevices.

The last day I saw you, in a rehab center,
your last "good day" according to my mother,
your only daughter,
we played a game of Yahtzee. You lost.
You smiled as we left, a brave, painful one that said
*Thank you, but this is it.*
I was 13. You were wearing your watch.
Was I?
