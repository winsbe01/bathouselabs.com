Dexter Gordon -- Go!

A nice little jazz album for ya. It is extremely melodious, more so than many jazz albums I've heard. The horn belts out the melody in each track, and lays a nice, comfortable path for the rest of the instruments to sail along. It's extremely accessible for all jazz tastes.

Listen to it if: you've never heard jazz before. This is a solid introduction, without too many crazy things to overwhelm the uninitiated.

Memorable Tunes: Cheese Cake. I feel like I've heard this song before, and it's a great number. Plus cheese cake is delicious.
