Buckethead -- Crime Slunk Scene

Interesting album. No lyrics, which may be a godsend if Buckethead is who I think he is. Sick shredding, nice melodies, well-rounded record.

Listen to it if: you like hard rock, but are tired of hearing the screams.

Memorable Tunes: none, which I don't necessarily consider a bad thing. The whole album ran together smoothly, like a whole work instead of a collection of songs.
