Mavis Staples -- We'll Never Turn Back

This album's chock full of Southern, I've-got-Jesus-in-my-heart soul. It features many traditional songs like We Shall Not Be Moved and Eyes On The Prize, all bursting at the seams with Mavis's strong voice. All of her songs are racially motivated, making numerous references to Dr. King and other prominent figures of the Civil Rights Movement. Given the subject matter, many of her songs are both a stark reminder of the cruel side of humanity as well as a motivational hymn, all brought forth in loud, proud rhythm and melody.

Listen to it if: Civil Rights era music has a soft spot in your heart.

Memorable Tunes: Down In Mississippi. I've never heard this one before, and I really enjoyed the lyrics. The story it told was sad, but the way the words fit together was wonderful.
