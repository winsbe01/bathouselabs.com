Crossfade -- Falling Away
[ Posted Mon, 02 May 2011 09:14:27 ]

This album rocks pretty hard, just like the other Crossfade album. Not sure if any of these got any radio time, but they sound like they could be takes from the other album. No songs violently grabbed my attention, but I was coding while it was on, so that could be my fault. Meh.

Listen to it if: you like noise in the background, and there is currently no noise in the background.

Memorable Tunes: oh, ya know, the ones from the other album.
