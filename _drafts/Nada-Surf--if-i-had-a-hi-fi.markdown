Nada Surf -- if I had a hi-fi

I like these guys. I admit, I wasn't fully and intently listening to the album, as it's finals week when I'm writing this and I'm trying to debug my final project at the moment. But what I heard, I really did enjoy. They're subtle, almost. Not too in-your-face, just a nice group to chill out to. Check 'em out.

Listen to it if: you're debugging code, apparently, because I found a bunch of bugs while listening to this album.

Memorable Tunes: Bye Bye Beaute. I was working and realized all of a sudden, "They're speaking French!" I love French, and it made me miss my French-speaking days. Oh, and it's a good song too.
