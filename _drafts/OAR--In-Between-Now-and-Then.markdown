O.A.R. -- In Between Now and Then

Do you know what O.A.R. stands for?? Ohh, you're gonna love this. "Of A Revolution." As in, a prepositional phrase, a collection of words that means nothing on its own. Is it the start...? The end...? The one time, I spilled a cup of coffee all over some stranger I met on the street who happened to be thinking...? We'll never know.

This being said, I actually liked the album. Like, a lot. Their songs are very catchy and enjoyable.

Listen to it if: you're not sure what a prepositional phrase is, but still like good music.

Memorable Tunes: Now. It's the first one, and made me check the name of the last song. It's Then. Clever, O.A.R., very clever.
