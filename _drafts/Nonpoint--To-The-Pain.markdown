Nonpoint - To The Pain

This album was quite enjoyable, I thought. It's pretty heavy, with a fair amount of
yelling and drop-D rumbling guitars. The vocalist, though, is very interesting to me, 
because he has a rap-type feel to his lyrics, but it's not matched with a rap beat.
This isn't a new idea, rap + metal, but usually the beat is more hip-hoppy, even if 
the instruments are still their same metal selves. This doesn't do that, it seems, but
*it works*. Go figure. I always like to hear people trying new things in music,
and get especially excited when it sounds good.

Listen to it if: you like metal but don't hate hip-hop, or you're interested in seeing
metal interpreted in another way.

Memorable Tunes: Alive And Kicking. This song reminded me of Linkin Park during the 
chorus (which I consider a good thing, although you may not). I think it was the combination
of the chord sounds with the lyrical resolutions that gave me that feel, because the
two bands are extremely different. It was a neat feeling, though.
