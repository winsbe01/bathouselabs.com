She's got a voice like Nina Simone, sings the blues like Nina Simone, and very well may be Nina Simone. Which I'm OK with, personally. She can really belt it out when the occasion calls for it, which it does many times on this album.

Memorable Tunes: any that have an animal in the title. Seriously, these are the best tracks on the record.
