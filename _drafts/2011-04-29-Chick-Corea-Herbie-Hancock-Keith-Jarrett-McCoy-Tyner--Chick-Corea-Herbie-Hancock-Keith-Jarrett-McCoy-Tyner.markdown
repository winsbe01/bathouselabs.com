I loves me some jazz, so this record had to be purchased/downloaded/ripped/however I happened to acquire it. They all kill it on this record; piano, drums, horn, everything. I danced the whole way through.

Listen to it if: you have the jazz bug at all, from full on, stage 4 jazz cancer, to just the jazz sniffles.

Memorable Tunes: This Is New. While this is probably the least memorable track title, I was digging the up-tempo rhythm. I was bouncing my leg along with the skilled drum work, and probably burned a few dozen calories in the process.
