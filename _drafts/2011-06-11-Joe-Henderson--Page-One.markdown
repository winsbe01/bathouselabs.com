Joe Henderson -- Page One
[ Posted Sat, 11 Jun 2011 10:00:07 ]

A nice jazz number for ya. Six tracks, which is pretty standard for a jazz album. I've always wondered why that was. Jazz is a very improvisational type of music, so if anything they are more prolific than, say, a rock band who writes all their songs ahead of time. So why do rock bands put out 12-song albums and jazz cats only 6? Is it a quicker release cycle? I don't know.

Anyways. Nice horns on this album, plus Mr. Henderson looks pretty boss in his suit and tie on the cover. That is, if you still look at cover art.

Listen to it if: you're in a situation in which you would listen to jazz. Sleeping? Eating? Making Love? Hey, I don't judge.

Memorable Tunes: Jinrikisha. Mostly because of the name.
