Daft Punk -- Discovery

I can honestly say that this is the first techno album I've ever listened to. I know a lot of people who dig techno, but I've never understood what the hype was about. After hearing this album...I still don't get it. Sure, a lot of the songs have cool sound effects going, but the repetition is unbearable. Some of this burden could be eased with some good lyrics, or at least a passionate and convincing-sounding voice. But no redemption; the lyrics are cheesy and piped through an unholy amount of autotune (well, any autotune is unholy, but still). Basically, I still don't get what my friends are talking about.

Listen to it if: you have minimal respect for music, or are dancing your face off in a club, high on life/ecstasy.

Memorable Tunes: Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger. No, not because of Kanye. This video is what makes this song memorable.
