sister sadie, on the blanket
drinks her tea with milk
light and cloudy, she feels rowdy
when she touches silk

she's a faker, met her maker
out behind the shed
arms a-blistered, face a-twisted,
eyes all streaked with red

gimme motion, drink the potion,
shoot yourself with fluid
wouldn't know your high from low
but you already drew it

crayon smudging, never budging,
blanket catching fire
smoky lungs, crusty thumbs
darker than a tire.

send me west, wish me best,
leave behind a stone
you'll go east, face the beast
found beneath your home

eat a cherry, soft and hairy,
plant the pit for luck
watch it grow as you go
wondering what it was
