Dangermouse & Jemini -- Ghetto Pop Life
[ Posted Tue, 03 May 2011 18:02:42 ]

Dope as HELL. I can't believe I haven't listened to this before! Sick beats and nasty raps throughout. Didn't recognize many of the featured artists, but they all were good too. If you like hip hop at all, get this album. Go, I'll wait.

Listen to it if: your idea of good hip hop is memorable verses dropped over catchy beats.

Memorable Tunes: Omega Supreme (who?!). I bobbed my head the whole way through the song, without even thinking about it. In the chorus, Jemini proclaims himself the "prince of the ghetto," and shit, if he consistently pumps tunes like this, I'm not surprised. I'd buy him the crown myself.
