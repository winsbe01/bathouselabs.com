Bee Gees -- This Is Where I Came In

I was under the impression that the Bee Gees were disco kings. This album ain't like that. After hearing them, I'm not sure if Michael Jackson is part of the band, or if Enrique Iglesias writes any of their songs, because I had those exact thoughts at certain points in the album. And honestly, both of these possibilities made me uncomfortable.

Listen to it if: you're not sure what you want to hear, but you know you want it to annoy you

Memorable Tunes: Technicolor Dreams. I'm about 78% sure this is a Queen song, which makes me wish Freddie had sung it, not these guys.
