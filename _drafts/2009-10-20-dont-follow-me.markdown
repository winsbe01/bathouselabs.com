(don't follow me) she said
and i dragged along her coattails
with my nose in the dirt,
breathing in her musky pheromones
like angel dust.

(trust in us) she cooed
and my blisters popped
thick pus into my battle scars,
my feet bruised, head down 
like a servant.

(i love you) she offered
and jumped on a sinking ship
towards Eden, hungry
for an apple, thirsty
for a snake.

(what happened) she asked
six-thousand-miles below,
and me, i scratch at mirrors
and reach for the scars
on my pale face.
