Dan Auerbach -- Keep It Hid
[ Posted Tue, 07 Jun 2011 10:11:06 ]

Solid. This solo album sounds a lot like Auerbach's other band, The Black Keys, so it sounds pretty darn good. The guitar is crunchy and bluesy, just like I like it, and just like The Black Keys have just about perfected. Not all songs are Keys B-Sides, though. They lend his instantly recognizable voice to some slightly different songs quite well.

Listen to it if: you've got love in your heart for The Black Keys and/or electric blues.

Memorable Tunes: Trouble Weighs A Ton. This acoustic number starts off the album, and sounds like it coulda been on the O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack. Neat sound.
