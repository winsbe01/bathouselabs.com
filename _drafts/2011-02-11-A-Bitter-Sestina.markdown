It's been a while since I read
a good story, not one used
to teach some backwards concept, under
the command of some near-dead
stick, inflated with old belief.
I don't think it's right.

Don't we as students have the right
to consume our own world, and read
what we deem important? My belief,
not a personal mantra used
to discredit yours, is some dead
men don't need to be dug up. Under

a heavy blanket of history, my under-
standing gets lost between a write-
er's words and his intentions. Maybe it's dead
language that trips me, or an avid read-
er's constant deja vu, but tasting used
thoughts bubbling from the belief

of a grave man, a belief
buried even before he himself was under
ground, makes me feel used.
Sure, we each have a moral right
to speak, feel, write, and read
what we wish, but when you're dead

it's hard to argue. When I am dead
and gone, I don't expect my belief
to outlive me, nor my words be read
by anyone who doesn't wish to under-
stand them. Words are not a objective rite
of passage, nor should they be used

as such. Their appropriate use
is to bring one out of an intellectual dead
land, to a bright
plain of self-acknowledgment, belief
in one's own under-
standing of the world. Read

these dead words, this twisted belief,
but look underneath them. They read
just like the used words they condemn. Right?
