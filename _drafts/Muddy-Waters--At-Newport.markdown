Muddy Waters -- At Newport

This is a nice blusey album from Muddy, showing both his fantastic musicianship and his ability to connect with the audience. The whole album makes you wanna just tap your foot and swing your head side to side. In fact, that's exactly what I did during the whole record, much to the confusion of the people I was working with.

Listen to it if: you know why "At Newport" is important.

Memorable Tunes: Tiger In Your Tank. This song is just fun and bouncy. Very enjoyable.
