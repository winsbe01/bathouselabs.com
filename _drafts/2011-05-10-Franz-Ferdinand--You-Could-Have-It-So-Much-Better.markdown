Franz Ferdinand -- You Could Have It So Much Better
[ Posted Tue, 10 May 2011 13:14:00 ]

These guys have a very different sound, like a Violent Femmes poppy-punky-rock that's fun to listen to, to an extent. This album was not the one that featured their radio hit, and I guess I can understand why. It was a good album, but none of them screamed "radio hit" to me. This isn't always a bad thing -- I think some bands make songs specifically for airtime, and I think that's poor practice. These guys, though, they've got good originality and a good fanbase, so they don't need to mess around with that.

Listen to it if: you just want something to dance around to.

Memorable Tunes: I'm Your Villain. Interesting rhythm, intriguing song.
