Excellent. Apparently, I've had a hidden gem in my library for years (hiding right
beneath Cold, I'm not too surprised I missed it). This album ROCKS. It's got head-bobbing rhythms, catchy melodies, and some interesting lyrics, too. Some of the songs reminded me of RATM/Audioslave: pentatonic hooks in groovy arrangements. Love it. I'm gonna need to look into these guys some more.

Listen to it if: you wanna hear a powerful sound from a sick group.

Memorable Tunes: all the ones that weren't on the radio. I recognized a few tracks that I must have heard on the radio throughout the years, but they were actually the worst tracks on the record, IMHO. If you were impressed by those, you ain't heard nothin yet.
