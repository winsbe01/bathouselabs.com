Moe. - No Doy

Interesting group. They've got a sort-of fun-in-the-sun vibe going, with strange lyrics
to go with. In a lot of their songs, they feature their guitarist heavily in solos and
other breaks that often last multiple minutes. The album looks short at 9 tracks, but
there are a few long tracks (one 8:30 and one 10+ minutes) that, well, make it longer.
Overall, I like them, but they are a band I'd need to listen to one track at a time.
A whole album straight is too much.

Listen to it if: you love guitar and long musical breaks.

Memorable Tunes: She Sends Me. One of the lines is "She loves me a whole freakin' lot."
Seeing as it's a very memorable, important line, it gets repeated 4 times over.
