Led Zeppelin -- In Through The Out Door
[ Posted Sun, 19 Jun 2011 10:00:06 ]

Ever since I listened to Led Zeppelin II, it's been my favorite Zep album. After hearing this one, it still is. That's not to say this one is bad, not by a long shot. They rock the blues as no other band can. But Zep lost their original oomph after Zoso, IMHO, and this album is no exception.

Listen to it if: you're a hardcore Zeppelin fan, or heard All My Love on the radio once.

Memorable Tunes: Hot Dog. I think this tune was a lot more obviously "da blues" than a lot of their songs, and it was nice to hear. I also enjoyed the piano runs, it was a nice addition.
