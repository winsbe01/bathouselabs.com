Love is human's felony
(The purpose of our woes),
A sweet macabre melody
A tainted God imposed
Created as a punishment
For sinners long deceased,
Or maybe 'twas a horrid curse
That Pandora released.
It serves no greater purpose but
To haunt us night and day
It renders us unconscious and
It carries us away.
A wiser man once told me that
The menace knows no time;
But when I leave my earthly lot,
I hope Love stays behind.
