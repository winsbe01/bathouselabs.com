MGMT -- Oracular Spectacular

I don't know if anyone else compares these two groups, but you already know how I feel about Techno/Electronica music. It's silly. Who's idea was it? I think I enjoyed about 2 songs on this album, if I stretch myself. I also think the vocalist sounds really...annoying.

Listen to it if: you like Electronica, and possibly worship the devil.

Memorable Tunes: Electric Feel. This is one song I like, mostly because I first heard it at a concert covered by a band playing instruments other than the synthesizer. It was great. I also like the timing, so I guess they do have a redeeming quality here.
