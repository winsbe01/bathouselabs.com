    <h2>Lil' Wayne -- Tha Carter</h2>

<p>This is the original we&#8217;re talking about, not the more popular and less inspired Carter III. This album features Weezy before he got big, and much like Jay-Z, his raps were much grittier and more interesting before anyone really knew who he was. I loved this album, minus the length. 21 long tracks really wore on me after awhile. But Weezy&#8217;s rhymes throughout are killer.</p>

<p>Speaking of Weezy&#8217;s rhymes, ever notice how he rhymes the same thing over and over again? Like, ending a group of four phrases with &#8220;in this bitch&#8221; or &#8220;mo&#8217; fucka&#8221;. I mean, they all rhyme, sure, and he rhymes the word previous to these repeated phrases, so it&#8217;s different, but still.</p>

<p><strong>Listen to it if:</strong> you love Wayne, but also underground hip-hop.</p>

<p><strong>Memorable Tunes:</strong> Cash Money Millionaires. The beat is nasty, and the verses are dope.</p>
