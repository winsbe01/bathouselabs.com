<p>This wasn&#8217;t as bad as I thought it was going to be. My experience with Kings Of Leon to this point was the seemingly endless radio airtime that &#8220;Sex On Fire&#8221; got, for reasons I can&#8217;t begin to fathom. I didn&#8217;t like that tune the first time I heard it, and the next 500+ times just further solidified my belief. Luckily, Kings Of Leon are good for more than one shitty radio hit. Their style isn&#8217;t hard or abrasive, it&#8217;s laid back. A lot of times I dig laid back music because something in it drives you to lay back with it. However, I don&#8217;t really feel it much with these guys, for some reason. Maybe it&#8217;s his voice, I don&#8217;t know. But I am happy to report that not one track on here sounded like &#8220;Sex On Fire.&#8221; Thank God.</p>

<p><strong>Listen to it if:</strong> you like family bands, like Oasis and the Jackson 5.</p>

<p><strong>Memorable Tunes:</strong> King Of The Rodeo. They&#8217;ve got some interesting lyrics here, as well as the closest to rapping I&#8217;ve ever heard a southern rock band attempt.</p>
