<p>It&#8217;s funny how one song can change an artist&#8217;s career forever. Like, you could be well respected, consistently putting out good singles and mediocre albums, and then all of a sudden, you agree to do a song with He Who Shall Not Be Named, and no one can take you seriously anymore.</p>

<p>Before this poor decision, though, Luda put out some pretty solid tunes. This album, though it&#8217;s got a handful of great songs, isn&#8217;t too strong overall, IMHO. This very well could be my personal tastes; I&#8217;m not a fan of the slower, love-oriented rap songs that are closer to an R&amp;B sort-of feel. I don&#8217;t listen to a rap album to hear these songs. Luda must like &#8216;em, though, cause he&#8217;s got a fair number of them on this record. Besides these songs, he kills it.</p>

<p><strong>Listen to it if:</strong> you like both rap and R&amp;B, or you&#8217;d like to remember what Luda was like before he lost credibility.</p>

<p><strong>Memorable Tunes:</strong> Southern Fried Intro. While most intros to rap albums are just a spoken intro, Ludacris takes it a step further. His raps on this track are extremely fast (think Busta Rhymes fast), and his lyrical talent is amazing.</p>
