<p>Okay, I know, <a href='http://www.bathouselabs.com/music/2011/06/04/Spoon--Gimme-Fiction.html' title='Gimme Fiction'>I just reviewed a Spoon album</a>. I just bought that album recently when Amazon put 1500+ albums on sale for $5 each (how could I not get it and a few others?). This was the first Spoon album I&#8217;ve ever bought, and the first time I heard the band and, to put it lightly, I fell in love. So I had to buy another. I did a quick search to see what album was &#8220;the best&#8221; (yeah, this is completely subjective, oh well). <em>Ga^5</em> was rated really well, so I went with it.</p>

<p>Overall, in my limited exposure to Spoon, I think I liked <em>Gimme Fiction</em> better. Before I get flamed by Spoon fans, hear me out. I think the novelty of the band completely entranced me. I had no idea what I was getting into before hearing <em>Gimme Fiction,</em> whereas I had pretty high expectations coming into <em>Ga^5.</em> I also really liked the spacey feel of the former, whereas this album didn&#8217;t quite feel as &#8220;out there&#8221; (I don&#8217;t always like &#8220;out there&#8221;, but it&#8217;s been speaking to me lately since my discovery of Radiohead). Just because I didn&#8217;t like this one as much doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m not going to listen to it again, nor will I write off Spoon as a band. I&#8217;m just gettin&#8217; started, baby!</p>

<p><strong>Listen to it if:</strong> I dunno, man, it&#8217;s good music! Isn&#8217;t that reason enough?</p>

<p><strong>Memorable Tunes:</strong> Don&#8217;t Make Me A Target. Real catchy. Intoxicatingly so. Dope start to the record.</p>
