<p>The Man in Black&#8217;s got a voice like no other. If you&#8217;ve never heard Mr. Cash sing, I highly encourage giving him a listen, even if old tyme country isn&#8217;t your thing. I&#8217;ve never heard a voice so deep and rich that wasn&#8217;t used exclusively for bedroom entertainment (Barry White). This is the first studio album of his I listened to, and I was excited because it didn&#8217;t have any of his hits. From the looks of it, he was covering traditional tunes on this album, a practice that isn&#8217;t used as much today for some reason (except maybe in Hollywood, if that counts). He does them justice, and does them with typical Johnny Cash flair.</p>

<p><strong>Listen to it if:</strong> you wanna know what country music is supposed to sound like.</p>

<p><strong>Memorable Tunes:</strong> Transfusion Blues. My roommate sings this song all the time, although the lyrics of the version he sings substitutes &#8220;transfusion&#8221; for &#8220;cocaine.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know which is the original version. Either way, it&#8217;s a catchy tune!</p>
