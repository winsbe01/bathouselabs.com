<p>Kanye West is&#8230;something else. Before my foray into hip-hop, I thought he sucked. After he interrupted Taylor Swift at the VMAs, I thought he was a jackass. Then I heard <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,</em> and I realized that only one of those two things is true. Well, really only half, cause Beyonce&#8217;s video was pretty great, and there are plenty of times when I wish Taylor Swift would shut her mouth.</p>

<p>Anyways, this album isn&#8217;t <em>MBDTF,</em> this is back from the &#8220;Golddigger&#8221; days. I was worried it would pale in comparison, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it held its own. Well, mostly. The album is really long at 21 songs, and I was getting kind of tired of them after awhile. But in the first 2/3 of the album, Kanye absolutely kills it, making sure we understand that he really is one of the best hip hop artists living. A force to be reckoned with. Also, very stylish. He loves designer clothes, more than some girls I know.</p>

<p><strong>Listen to&#8230;</strong> hold on, Imma let you finish, but I just wanted to say that my sunglasses are the most ridiculous piece of clothing of all time. <em>OF ALL TIME.</em></p>

<p><strong>Memorable Tunes:</strong> Drive Slow. I want to crank this in my car. It&#8217;s got a steady, hypnotizing groove that&#8217;s absolutely intoxicating. On second thought, maybe I shouldn&#8217;t crank it in my car&#8230;</p>
