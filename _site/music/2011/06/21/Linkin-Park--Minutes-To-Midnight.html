<p>When I was a kid, Linkin Park was my favorite band of all time. I used to be a swimmer, and if you&#8217;ve ever been a swimmer, you know there&#8217;s a lot of down time at swim meets. I used to bring my blue (slightly broken) Sony Walkman to the pool and listen to <em>Hybrid Theory</em> on repeat. I did this for at least a couple seasons, and I probably listened to the album at least 3 times each meet, so in total, I probably heard that album in its entirety somewhere around 150 times within the span of a year. Needless to say, I was in love with them.</p>

<p>When <em>Meteora</em> came out, I bought the special edition and played it in my trusty Walkman a multitude of times as well. It didn&#8217;t get spun as much as its younger sibling, but it got its fair share of plays. I didn&#8217;t have the same connection as I did with <em>Hybrid Theory,</em> a connection I have rarely felt in my short time on this planet. By the time <em>Minutes to Midnight</em> came out and I heard the radio singles, I just wasn&#8217;t as excited about Linkin Park anymore, having moved on to bigger and better things.</p>

<p>That was years ago, and this is really the first time I&#8217;ve listened to <em>Minutes To Midnight</em> as an album. Do I regret the wait? No. As I suspected when I was a wee tot, this album couldn&#8217;t get a grip on my musical tastes as <em>Hybrid Theory</em> did, and connected with me even less than <em>Meteora</em> did. Is it a bad album? No, but considering Linkin Park&#8217;s discography, they peaked early and have been riding the downward trend for some time.</p>

<p><strong>Listen to it if:</strong> you know &gt; 90% of the words to every song on <em>Hybrid Theory.</em> Even if this album doesn&#8217;t come close, the Linkin Park feel is comforting and reminiscent of the innocent days of yore.</p>

<p><strong>Memorable Tunes:</strong> The Little Things Give You Away. This is a powerful song with a big sound. I think it&#8217;s a great way to end an album.</p>
