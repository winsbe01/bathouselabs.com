<p>A few years back, I was pretty into <em>Start Something.</em> It wasn&#8217;t my favorite album, sure, but it was a challenging album, one I listened to fairly regularly. Remembering this, I was excited to visit one of their older albums, both to see how it matched up to <em>Start Something,</em> and to see if their appeal held up over time. What I found was less than I hoped for. While I still enjoyed their sound, this album seemed a lot more&#8230;forgettable, than their later releases. It just didn&#8217;t seem as strong. To be fair, it was their first release, and their spark might not have come until later.</p>

<p><strong>Listen to it if:</strong> you&#8217;re a fan of alternative rock, or aren&#8217;t a fan of white space.</p>

<p><strong>Memorable Tunes:</strong> Still Laughing. As in, it somehow ended up on the list twice, so I remembered hearing it the second time it came on.</p>
