    <h2>Rise Against -- Siren Song of the Counter Culture</h2>

<p>A few tracks into this album, I came to a realization: although their first song was hardcore, with throat-ripping screaming and heavy guitars, they were progressively getting whinier and whinier. It was at this moment that a picture of who these guys might be flashed before my eyes (brain?): a group of grown white boys who were angry <em>for no reason.</em> They probably grew up in the &#8216;burbs somewhere, maybe outside Boston, and went to nice public (or even private!) schools. They might have even gotten good grades and had cute girlfriends. But for some reason, they&#8217;re just <em>super</em> pissed off.</p>

<p>At the end of the album, when I re-read the title and put it in context, I realized that it was the most appropriate title of all time. <em>Of all time.</em> Let&#8217;s have a brief history lesson: what was the counter culture? A movement that arose during the Vietnam War composed of young people who hated authority and loved weed. Where did this movement come from, you might ask? Colleges. Namely, UC Berkley and Columbia, also known as schools which, in the late 1960s, were populated by a large number of rich, white kids who grew up with all the pleasantries and unspoken privileges of suburban childhood.</p>

<p>And what is a siren song? From Homer&#8217;s <em>Odyssey,</em> the sirens are the whiny wet bitches who hang out near sharp rocks and entice poon-starved sailors to steer into them. It&#8217;s impossible not to hear their song and go nuts, unless you&#8217;re tied to something (which is what Odysseus did, probably to make sure Poseidon took note of his testicular prowess).</p>

<p>So, as we can see, Rise Against is calling their album the intoxicating music that smoked-out, rebellious white teenagers find absolutely irresistible. And you know what? <em>They are so right.</em></p>

<p><strong>Listen to it if:</strong> you got angry after the first sentence, or stopped reading and went to get Cheetos after the second.</p>

<p><strong>Memorable Tunes:</strong> Swing Life Away. Because they couldn&#8217;t just stick to bitchy, mediocre alt-rock, they had to have an acoustic radio hit too. Who are these guys, Plain White T&#8217;s?</p>
